Why wasn't I being paid that already?,700,WorkReform,30801,0,1654179780.0,,v3a0im,<function Submission.id_from_url at 0x7ff321b94310>,False,True,False,,0,False,13258,https://redd.it/v3a0im,False,False,550051,public,1,0.94,,False,/r/WorkReform/comments/v3a0im/submitted_my_resignation_this_week_and_told_my/,"Took a job in my field back in November that paid in the $50-60k range (on par for entry level in my city).  For the first few months, I really enjoyed it, as I was given a lot of autonomy over my projects and I worked well with my manager.  Over time, though, I realized the organization itself was extremely mismanaged and its priorities were all over the place.  On top of that, most of the people I worked with outside my own group were crazy immature, to the point that I felt uncomfortable interacting with most of them (e.g., meetings between departments would turn into passive-aggressive dick measuring contests, social interactions ranged from bizarre to entirely inappropriate).

My manager tried his hardest, but over time, the place started to wear me down.  He did tell me that he would try to get me up above the $60k mark by the end of the year, but in the long run, that'd be a miniscule addition to my check.  My only other incentive was constant positive feedback from said manager.  I'm not cocky in the slightest, but I am willing to admit that I was *killing it* in my position.  So much so that it made others around me look bad.  The lack of upward mobility in both pay and position (my team is me and the manager, and they're not leaving anytime soon) was just too much.  My manager picked up on this, too, as they would frequently ask me how I was doing and if I wanted out.

I started looking for something else a few months back.  A few weeks ago, I was contacted by a recruiter about a similar job at another place in town.  Fully remote (my current job is 100% in-office), part of a much larger, experienced team, and it was a 25% pay bump.  All of those perks were nice, but the pay in particular was the selling point.  I'm currently the breadwinner for my family (partner is in school), so any increase in pay is absolutely crucial.

I sat down with my manager the other day and let them know I was leaving.  I told them it was nothing personal, and that the pay was the driving factor.  They asked if I would be willing to tell them what I was offered.  I gave them the number, and their response was (I shit you not), ""Oh!  Well we could have matched that, that wouldn't have been an issue.""

...

So, manager knew my worth.  Manager knew I was getting burnt out.  Yet, manager only offered me a pittance as incentive to stay long-term, yet that extra 25% ""wouldn't have been an issue""?  Why in the holy hell wasn't I being paid that already if it wasn't an issue?

Needless to say, I'm still leaving.

**Pay your fucking talent.**


**EDIT:** A lot of people are asking why I didn't ask for a raise.  As indicated in my post, my manager kept floating the whole, ""I'll pay you X by the end of the year"" thing in front of me.  This led me to believe that any raise would cap out at that amount.  There was no reason to believe I would have been offered anything more than that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/v3a0im/submitted_my_resignation_this_week_and_told_my/

But it's very expensive and selective. So very few people get to enjoy the education they offer.

However, they've made **CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming**, available online for free. And upon completion, you even get a free certificate from Harvard.

I can't overstate how good the course is. The professor is super engaging. The lectures are recorded annually, so the curriculum is always up to date. And it's very interactive, with weekly assignments that you complete through an in-browser code editor.

To top it all off, once you complete the course, you get a free certificate of completion from Harvard. Very few online courses offer free certificates nowadays, especially from top universities.

You can take the course for free on Harvard OpenCourseWare:

[https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)

(Note that you can also take it through edX, but there, the certificate costs $150. On Harvard OpenCourseWare, the course is exactly the same, but the certificate is entirely free.)

[ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2fyyoy/i_dont_care_if_youre_starving_the_customer_always/) published on Sept. 10, 2014. 

Alright reddit. So normally I'd make a throwaway account for this type of shit. But not today. I am so pissed, I don't even care. So anyway, here is the story. It's 2 PM today, and I am starving. I am just coming back from the fast food joint down the street and I am walking towards the break room with my food in hand hoping to enjoy a quiet, peaceful lunch to re-energize myself so I can continue dealing with the endless waves of snarky customers that my workplace is notorious for attracting. As I am getting to the door, this blonde woman, around her 50s, begins to follow me (I can feel her following me) and she begins to do that ""pssst!"" noise that is so fucking annoying. She continues about 3 times or so but I ignore her, since, you know, I am not a fucking dog or anything. After she realizes that I am not going to react to her summons, the conversation goes a little something like this:

**Woman**: Ex-CUUUUUUUUUUUSE ME!!!

**Me**: Oh sorry ma'am, I am on break right now. But let me get one of the other employees to help you out.

At this point I begin to reach for my walkie talkie to call someome to the aisle for help, but she isn't having any of it.

**Woman**: WHAAAAAAAAAAT?! I will NOT be treated like this! I am a valued customer and I demand to be treated as such! You will provide your service to me RIGHT NOW and that is THAT! No questions asked!

**Me**: Ma'am, I would be happy to help you but my lunch break is only 30 minutes and---

**Woman**: I don't give a shit! I don't care if you're starving! The customer always comes first!

At this point, I didn't even retaliate. I just turned around and ignored her as I walked into the break room with my key and shut the door behind me. She began to angrily pound on it for a few seconds until she finally stopped, presumably because a co-worker came to the rescue. I later found out that she complained to the manager, and of course the manager simply brown-nosed her and told her that I would be ""dealt with"" as an employee should ""never refuse service to a customer"" even if they are on break. This supposedly applies even if I call an employee over the walkie for help.

Honestly, I am just venting. I am getting sick and fucking tired of this company and the management. Especially the customers though.

Anyway, there is my rant. What the fuck is wrong with people man?

---

[UPDATE 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2g221i/update_i_dont_care_if_youre_starving_the_customer/) posted the next day.

Anyway, I decided to follow you guys' advice, and so I called corporate to complain that I was basically reprimanded for following policy and refusing service to a customer during my break. Of course corporate immediately sided with me, and everything seemed like it was going to be fixed and my name would be cleared. But no, of course not. In the world of retail, things aren't always so clear cut. Lo and behold, there's another factor here: **The fucking bitch** apparently called corporate herself and basically demanded that I be fired for being rude to her. Now guys, the thing is, the store has cameras. And turns out they investigated, and since the audio is not available, the only thing seen was me walking away from the woman and slamming the break room door behind me.

Now, you'd think that's bad enough right? Wrong. Guess what? I asked a supervisor (who is a long-time buddy of mine) to check the punch-in sheet (it is automatically filled in by the computer but is editable by management) just out of curiosity. And guess what? Someone fucking **deleted** my break time that was logged into the system.

So now, not only am I being accused of refusing service to a customer, but I am also being accused of not clocking out and leaving the premises to get food.

What the fuck reddit? Was this a computer error or did the manager really do this on purpose to save his own ass? Or does he simply not like me? (We have a long history of run-ins with eachother, and it is openly well known that he does not like me).

But reddit, here's the thing. I will **NOT** lay down and die like a bitch. I will fucking **fight** this thing to the end, even if right now it seems like I have no allies.

I don't know what I can do to fight this thing, but I will damn well try my hardest. Updates will follow if something new comes to light.

Thanks.

[UPDATE 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2g6g1d/update_2_i_dont_care_if_youre_starving_the/) posted a day later. 

So basically, 2 big things happened today, and I will try to explain them in as much detail as possible.

(1) I woke up bright and early and made a call to corporate. My plan here was simply to state that I needed my issue investigated further, even if it seemed like there was no problem on their end. As expected, the person on the other end of the phone told me the same thing that they had already told me the first time I had called. But then I said the magic word; subpoena. As soon as I made the calm, yet firm threat, the person immediately told me to hold on for a second. He got his supervisor on the line, to whom I explained my situation once again, and he assured me that he would see into the matter. Oh, and I also asked for a way to e-mail the president of the company, and I sent an e-mail to him explaining my situation as well. So that was that, but I didn't stop there. See, I had another plan; I was going to catch my manager myself red-handed. You know, just in case corporate dun goofs.

(2) So I walk into work, and I immediately go into the manager's office. I stand in front of him, and the conversation goes like this:

**Me**: I have to speak with you about something really important.

**Manager**: Can it wait? I need to finish looking over these documents before 12.

**Me**: No, it can't wait. **Supervisor's name** told me that my clock in and clock out time from lunch 3 days ago was not on the log. I know I punched out and in, so what happened?

**Manager**: Huh... Weird. I'll look into it for ya, alright?

**Me**: Oh no need! I already called corporate, and they said they'd look into it personally.

At this point, I had the widest shit-eating grin I have ever had in my life. It felt good man. **Real** fucking good.

The manager audibly gulps at this point, no doubt shitting bricks.

**Manager**: You know, that wasn't really necessary. You could have come to me about this first.

**Me**: Oh I know, but I just didn't want to waste your time, seeing as how you're always busy and all. You have more important things to do, like look over documents.

At this point, he visibly begins to get annoyed by my attitude and my sarcastic tone. But I'm just enjoying it way too much.

**Manager**: Now listen, Tomato_Ketchup, I'm not really liking your tone right now.

**Me**: I apologize. Anyways, I just wanted to give you a heads up in case corporate asks you any questions. You know how they are.

At this point some of you might be thinking why I said that last part. Why? Because I had a small suspicion that since he is a recently-made manager (3 months now), he probably didn't know that the system logs all deletions and re-entries. Sure, you would be told this if you become manager, but I was trying my luck at this point because (A) I don't see who else could have deleted my log times, and (B) If it was him who deleted them, he obviously didn't know about the fact that the deletions are tracked.

So what was my end-game here? Simple. I was hoping that due to this threat about corporate, he would simply go back and **add** my times back onto the log. And guess what? He did *just* that.

A couple of minutes after our conversation he comes up to me and tells me:

**Manager**: Tomato_Ketchup, I found out what the problem was. There was a glitch in the system and apparently it didn't register your punches. But everything is fixed now. Your log times should be there now.

**Me**: Wow, thanks. I appreciate it.

**Manager**: No problem...

But wait a minute, there's more! Just a couple of hours into my shift, I see the manager leaving the store, angrily slamming the manager office's door on his way out. When I asked my supervisor buddy what had happened, the conversation went like this:

**Me**: Dude why is he so angry?

**Supervisor**: I don't know. He was with corporate on the phone for a few minutes and then he asked me why I told you that the time logs were missing. Hold up let me find out.

So my supervisor runs out the front doors to catch up with my manager. They talk for a while outside, after which my manager gets into his car and angrily drives off. Then my supervisor comes back inside, walks up to me, and says:

**Supervisor**: Dude. I'm sorry to tell you this but he's fucked. Corporate found evidence of data tampering in the punch-in log. Apparently he deleted your times yesterday, and added them back today this morning to cover his ass.

**Me**: Wow...

**Supervisor**: Yep...

**Me**: How didn't he know about the system's ability to track that stuff?

**Supervisor**: I don't know man.

So there's that. He will probably get fired and I will probably... Well, keep my job. I could not have done with without you guys or your support, and I certainly could not have come up with half of the ideas or thought processes that got me out of this hole.

And for those of you saying that I should have just let it be instead of causing more problems? No. That is **not** how you do things when someone is trying to fuck with your life.

Thanks again for all your support. I hope I have more stories to share with you all in the near future (hopefully customer-related and not job-threatening).

Tomato_Ketchup, signing off.

As some of you have noticed, I've been chasing down bugs posted here recently. I'm now having trouble keeping track of issues and following up on everything that deserves a response. It turns out having folks reach out to individual posters on Reddit isn't something that scales well on a game the size of Dota.

We'd like to try using a public Github issue tracker to keep track of submitted issues. Our goals here are to be transparent about what our response is to any issue, and to let the community vote on what's important to resolve. The voting is hugely important - Reddit is *amazing* because if something matters to many players it gets a lot of upvotes so we have clear signal on what's important to you. Even if you don't submit any new bugs on the tracker, upvoting the bugs you think are important is very valuable and will help us know what to prioritize.

This is an experiment for us and we're trying something new, please be understanding when things change as we learn what works well and what doesn't.

The tracker is up on my personal Github account right now at https://github.com/jeffhill/Dota2/issues.

Thank you and have a great day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/v3cabk/dota2_bug_tracker/

I was sleeping over at my friend‚Äôs house, and we were home alone. We smoked some weed and were really really baked. We realized we NEEDED some munchies at about 1:00am so we walked about 2 miles to the 24/7 grocery store. My friend was really paranoid the whole time we walked, thinking someone was going to jump out of the bushes or something, idk.

We make it to the store, get a shit ton of snacks. My friend says she is too scared to walk back home so we sit in the little lobby in front of the grocery store trying to find a taxi (we only had cash with us so uber was not an option).  While we‚Äôre sitting and failing to find a taxi because we lived in suburbia where there are no taxis in the middle of the night, we see a group of 3 guys around our age come in.

5 minutes later the three of them RUN out of the store, all holding some kind of liquor. The one employee half-assedly chased them to the door but just shrugged when they escaped and sighed. At this point we realized we weren‚Äôt gonna find any taxis so we decided to suck it up and just walk home.

we‚Äôre leaving the store and walk past this little sitting area maybe 75ft from the grocery store entrance. There were the 3 guys, just chillin and drinking their free booze. One of them shouts asking if we‚Äôd like to join them. I immediately panic whisper to my friend ‚Äúno no no‚Äù but for some reason she says yes. Idk how she was too scared to walk 2miles in the dark but not scared enough to say no to these guys.  Well I‚Äôm not leaving her so I sit down too. They give us each a beer and they‚Äôre talking about random high school stuff. They all seemed to be pretty intoxicated already, and one guy seemed to be on something else too. He was incoherent and flopping around the ground. Not in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying‚Äù way, just in a ‚ÄúIm really fucked up‚Äù way.

We sit there for maybe 20mins before my friend realizes this maybe wasn‚Äôt a good idea so we look at each other like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get f out of here what are we doing‚Äù and say we need to get home.  They say they don‚Äôt mind walking us home. And say that maybe they can come to my friend‚Äôs house and smoke some weed. Which is obviously not a great idea and we said we were okay, but they followed us anyways so we decide to walk to the park nearby her house and then ditch them there. 

They threw the one really fucked up guy in a shopping cart and offered to carry our shopping bags. We did buy a lot of munchies so we agree. they throw our stuff on top of the guy. They were nice guys, we just were not down to have them in our house and they were very pushy about wanting to come over.

We make it to the park and they disperse, the fucked up guy tries to climb over the playground fence but gets stuck and just stays there, hanging over the fence. The other two start dicking around the playground. My friend and I grab our shit and make a break for the trees. They didn‚Äôt even notice we left.

We get back to her house, laughing about how weird that whole situation was and dive into our munchies at last. We pass out in front of the tv.

The next morning, her mom came home while we were making some breakfast. We‚Äôre just chit-chatting when she asks if we heard about ‚Äúthat hit and run over a drug deal gone wrong involving some students at our rival high school‚Äù

We hadn‚Äôt so we asked for more info. She pulls up a news article showing 4 mugshots, 3 of which are the guys we met the night before. Turns out they and a girl tried to get weed without paying for it, and ended up like pushing the dealer out of the moving car or something like that (maybe she climbed on the side and fell off i don‚Äôt remember) and killed her.

We just looked at each other like

üëÅüëÑüëÅ

TL;DR: met some sketchy guys in the middle of the night and hung out with them for a bit. Realized the next day they killed a girl hours before chilling with us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v3czah/tifu_by_hanging_out_with_3_murderers/

I lost my job, my long-term relationship of almost 10 years dissolved and I had a falling out with my dad, leading me to damn near a mental breakdown. 

So I decided to make a clean break of it and do something I had always fantasized about - I left the big city and everything in my life behind and travelled up to northern British Columbia, Canada with nothing but a backpack, some clothes and an e-reader. Found work at a remote wilderness lodge just doing maintenance and odd jobs. The plan was to disconnect myself from everything and be somewhere in nature with barely any internet and cell service.

I really just wanted to isolate myself, lose myself in some good books, and recalibrate my mental state after all the shit that went down. The last 12-13 months have basically just been work, read and hike/camp among the beautiful northern landscapes the lodge was located in.

I managed to read close to 40 books in that timeframe, and I wanted to share my thoughts on them with the sub as reading, more than anything, helped me center myself and get some perspective on my life. I read across a variety of genres and have ranked them with a little mini-review below, from worst to best. I didn't do an overall ranking, but rather ranked the books I read within their specific genres/categories.

**Classics/Literary Fiction:**

8. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: Honestly, this book kind of irritated me in how transparent it was at being shamelessly emotionally manipulative. It was certainly very well-written, but I found Jude just unbelievably stupid as a character and after a certain point in the story, found myself losing any kind of empathy towards him. The rest of the characters are fairly non-descript. The book is kind of morbidly fun to see just how over the top the misery porn can get though, but I hesitate to actually call it ‚Äúgood‚Äù

7. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway: I‚Äôm starting to think that Hemingway might just not be for me. I‚Äôve read The Old Man and the Sea and The Sun Also Rises previously, and found them ‚Äújust okay‚Äù. That was my prevailing sentiment towards AFtA as well. I do like Hemingway‚Äôs terse, succinct style, but in this one, I felt it actually kind of worked against him because it makes both the war setting and central relationship feel a bit flat. But the worse thing about the book is the character of Catherine. Jesus christ, she is annoying. Just an insipid, silly character. I did like the downbeat, depressing ending though

6. A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens: I have to admit, I was ready to hate this book throughout the first couple hundred pages. It‚Äôs dense, slow and filled with a shit ton of what fills like unimportant minutiae. But it eventually comes together, and the slow buildup really manages to create an epic scope and magnitude that are unlike anything else I‚Äôve read from old Charles. It‚Äôs a story that demands concentration and attention, and by the final, powerful third act, it‚Äôs well worth it.  

5. East of Eden by John Steinbeck: An epic, multi-generational family saga, East of Eden is a work that for me works masterfully on both an epic and an personal scale. It‚Äôs hard to encompass everything this story does so well in a short review. It‚Äôs both a biblical, mythical retelling as well as an intimate character study punctuated with some best-in-class writing. It makes the Salinas Valley into a living, breathing entity of its own, with these macro and micro tales of good and evil spanning its expanse. Also, fuck Cathy Ames. All my homies hate Cathy Ames

4. To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf: This is my first encounter with Woolf, and it solidified for me that I will be coming back to her body of work multiple times. It was definitely a bit of a struggle getting into it, as you‚Äôre jusyt thrown into the deep end with Woolf‚Äôs abstract prose and stream of consciousness style. But once you grab hold of what Woolf is trying to do, it becomes a beautifully melancholic story with a pastoral feel that nonetheless manages to really capture a huge gamut of human emotions and perspectives

3. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy: Horrifically beautiful. It‚Äôs fairly challenging to start, but once you start vibing with McCarthy‚Äôs style and writing, the narrative just completely immerses you into it. It‚Äôs like a surreal, fever-dream, gruesomely violent vision of the Wild West with gorgeous depictions of the landscape, brilliantly written dialogue and prose that begs to be read over and over, and the most unforgettable villain I‚Äôve come across in literature. This is a novel I can see myself going back to time and time again

2. The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky: I was flip-flopping between this one and Middlemarch as the #1 book in the classics/literature category but it‚Äôs very close. This book is, on the surface, ‚Äújust‚Äù a murder-mystery but in actuality is a dense, complex philosophical exploration of various facets of life. This is a masterpiece of character development as we see ideas of free will, morality and family told through multiple different lenses. It‚Äôs also a bit of a treatise on religion and the meaning of faith. In short, it‚Äôs a *lot* and there‚Äôs probably a ton that I didn‚Äôt even get in one read-through. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs an epic tale that I found both illuminating and entertaining

1. Middlemarch by George Eliot: A wonderful, atmospheric slow burn, and might be one of the best books I‚Äôve ever read. Honestly probably in my top 5 of all time. I found it to be such an all-encompassing look at the things that make us human, and feels both incredibly personal and universal at the same time (kind of like East of Eden). It‚Äôs a story about marriage (hit me particularly close to hom) and about sacrifice, with masterfully sketched characters and an exploration of life in era to the minutest details. ‚ÄúImmersive‚Äù is a word that gets thrown around a lot for books but that‚Äôs what Middlemarch truly is ‚Äì a totally lived in feeling of a small, nowhere English town a couple of hundred years ago. I found it unforgettable

**Historical Fiction:**

5. Shogun by James Clavell: This is a huge, huge novel, both in its page count, as well as the scope of the story and the characters. Historically speaking, it did seem a little mythologized and perhaps overly romanticizing of the whole samurai/warrior culture, and the main protagonist is a bit of a bland nothing white male fantasy. Clavell‚Äôs prose is also merely workmanlike. But as an entertaining story, it fares much better, and is actually very well-paced for something that‚Äôs almost 1200 pages. 

4. Hawaii by James Michener: This is my first book written by Michener, and I can see why he came to be seen as the godfather of historical fiction. This, like Shogun, is an absolute unit of a book, and although it‚Äôs plenty flawed, I came away from it with something close to awe just based on the sheer scope of the timeframe that Michener captures here. the formation of Hawaii in the first chapter is some of the best storytelling I read in the past year. However, this is a book that gets progressively less interesting as it goes and moves into the ‚Äúpresent‚Äù time, and the characters are little more than pawns. Still recommended though especially if you find Hawaii interesting

3. Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel: Once I figured out that everytime this book uses ‚Äúhe‚Äù (which is a LOT), it‚Äôs almost always referring to the main character Thomas Cromwell, I started to enjoy it a lot more. It‚Äôs really eloquently written and Cromwell is a brilliantly developed character. It‚Äôs a story that requires a lot of focus but to me it eventually paid off, and the narrative really carries you along once you get used to Mantel‚Äôs idiosyncrasies. 

2. I, Claudius by Robert Graves: well-written, funny and hugely informative. Really a slow burn character study of the eponymous Claudius, and the compulsively entertaining look at the back-door dealings and family conflicts of that era in Rome. I thought it also did a pretty great job at exploring the thirst of power and the excesses certain people are willing to go to achieve it. Just a great, multifaceted read overall.

1. Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry: This book is seriously a contender for one of my top 10 favourites of all time. To begin with, the two main protagonists are just incredibly written and developed, and the attachment you have towards them carries you through to the monumental length of the narrative. It‚Äôs an emotionally powerful story with an excellent main plot and smaller side stories that are all great in their own right. Just a truly epic tale told by a master storyteller

**Science Fiction:**

6. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline: I imagine I would have probably liked this book if I was still in high school, crammed as it is full of video game power fantasies and endless pop culture references. But good god, actually reading it as an adult was a painful experience. Other than being a compendium of 80s homages, it fails spectacularly on almost every level. Bad writing, bad characters, tedious, dull storytelling. It‚Äôs frankly just awful

5. Foundation by Isaac Asimov: Look, I know this is a foundational (hehe) ‚Äúcanon‚Äù text in the sf genre, but I just found it to have too many issues to truly enjoy. The concepts and ideas are great ‚Äì eye-opening and fascinating ‚Äì but for me, the book fell flat in almost every other area. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts, the writing style is about as wooden as it gets, and the book is very much of its time (i.e. dated af) when it comes to women. Really, this is just a collection of scenes with characters sitting in rooms and talking. Dynamic storytelling it is not, despite the interesting concepts

4. Dune by Frank Herbert: I don‚Äôt know if this will be unpopular or not, but I honestly thought Dune was just‚Ä¶ok. I watched and loved the movie, and decided to jump into the book afterwards. While I do appreciate the worldbuilding that went into it ‚Äì as well as the often weird, surreal 60s drugged-out atmosphere ‚Äì as a piece of storytelling I feel like Dune has been improved upon over the years. I still respected it as a forerunner of so many different kinds of sff stories we have these days, but taken on its own merits I found it to be interesting but rather turgid on the whole

3. Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: I can‚Äôt imagine a more definitive fictional story about Mars than this one. The amount of thoughtful research and extrapolation of science, technology, politics and society that has gone into this novel is simply phenomenal. It honest to god at times reads like an instruction manual for the first Mars colonists, whenever we end up getting there. That does work to the novel‚Äôs detriment at times though, as it can feel a bit dry and overly technical at parts. But I still found it to be a grand, immersive read, and the somewhat boring parts were more than compensated for by the overall sweep of the story and the author‚Äôs incredible vision of a Martian future for humanity

2. The Dispossessed by Ursula K Le Guin: Complex, thoughtful and human. This isn‚Äôt the first Le Guin book that will appear on this list either. This book is the best depiction of a realistic utopia I‚Äôve ever seen in fiction, and it does what the best sf does and presents a fascinating ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù look at a cool concept. Unlike a lot of sf, it succeeds hugely in two other areas. The first is creating a fully-realized central character ‚Äì Shevek is an awesome protagonist with a lot of depth and nuance. The second is Le Guin‚Äôs inimitable prose, which is elegant and beautiful while still somehow managing to be simple and concise

1. Hyperion by Dan Simmons: This might be the best sf novel I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs the rare sf story (imo) that is both excellent from both a literary and ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù perspective. It‚Äôs just crammed full of cool ideas and concepts, and I loved the Canterbury Tales-esque structure, which leads to the book‚Äôs greatest asset ‚Äì the characters. I found each ‚Äúpilgrim‚Äù to be fascinating and well-developed, and their respective stories were beautifully told, ranging from thrilling, scary, funny to downright haunting and tragic. The Priest‚Äôs Tale and the Scholar‚Äôs Tale have both been etched in my mind since I read them. This book is an incredible achievement and to me a high-water mark for the speculative fiction genre

**Horror:**

5. The Troop by Nick Cutter: Not much to say about this one. It‚Äôs a pulpy, B-movie-esque story without much in the way of characterization, prose or depth. But it does disgusting body horror better than almost any other horror novel I‚Äôve ever read. Some of the scenes are downright grotesque and repulsive, and I have a high tolerance for that kind of stuff. It‚Äôs a quick, easy read and but not particularly memorable outside of the gross-out factor 

4. The Elementals by Michael McDowell: A fun, atmospheric and really well written Southern Gothic horror story. This book is akin to Haunting of Hill House in that it deals in subtlety and a sense of creeping doom. It‚Äôs a definitely slow burn but that really helps it in building a stifling sense of gloom and dread. The characters are fascinating and it really is very well-written. Highly recommended if you like horror novels focused more on atmosphere than gore/jump scares

3. The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories/The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories by HP Lovecraft: I‚Äôm combining these two collections into one as they‚Äôre essentially just one big compendium. After reading these, I‚Äôve become a huge Lovecraft fan. I‚Äôm aware of his racism and xenophobia but I believe in separating the art from the artist to a certain degree. Anyway, I thought these stories were mostly pretty awesome. I actually love Lovecraft‚Äôs verbose, overwrought prose ‚Äì it really gives the stories a certain level of operatic, melodramatic ambiance. Some of the Dunsany-inspired stories are downright gorgeous. The mythos is fascinating and in the best stories ‚Äì At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow over Innsmouth, The Colour out of Space etc. ‚Äì he reaches a kind of dark, horrific grandeur. Reading these in the remote northern landscape was truly a fantastic experience

2. The Books of Blood by Clive Barker: Dark, horrific, visceral, erotic ‚Äì this is an incredible collection of horror short stories. Barker is a hell of a writer ‚Äì a few levels above most in this genre, and he has a uniquely twisted and dark imagination obsessed with the human body, and in particular, sexuality, and how the body can be a battleground of all sorts of horrors, physical or otherwise. Some of them also have a dreamlike, surreal feel to them. In particular, I was blown away by ‚ÄúIn the Hills, the Cities‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs a story unlike any I‚Äôve ever read before, mind-boggling, bizarre and haunting. Also of note are ‚ÄúThe Midnight Meat Train‚Äù, ‚ÄúRawhide Rex‚Äù and ‚ÄúDread‚Äù, but honestly they are all pretty damn great even at their weakest

1. The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson: The amazing show led me to the book, and although the source material is almost completely different other than sharing some names with the characters from the show, it‚Äôs an incredible story in its own right. Jackson‚Äôs prose is probably the best I‚Äôve come across in this genre, and her ability to create atmosphere and mood is without peer. The setting just feels alive in all its creepy, gothic glory. It‚Äôs a fairly small, intimate story but a very powerful, often gut-wrenching one in how it captures the main character‚Äôs very human flaws and insecurities. In the end, it leaves us pondering about what‚Äôs more terrifying ‚Äì a seemingly haunted house full of ghosts or the doubts and self-loathing in our own hearts?

**Non-Fiction:**

5. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari: Yeah‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt really feeling this one. I understand why it‚Äôs popular and it did start off very well. But the vast majority of the book is just too full of speculation and the author‚Äôs own musings without much in the way of concrete evidence. I also found his mythologizing of hunting and gathering and seeming dislike of the agricultural revolution strange and misguided. The whole book just felt a mile wide and inch deep. Superficial, surface-level exploration without any true insight or in-depth analysis of a complex topic

4. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can‚Äôt Stop Talking by Susan Cain: Wow, if ever there was a non-fiction book tailor-made for Reddit, this is it lol. I have to admit, this book did come to me at the perfect time, as I was in a pretty closed-off, solitary mood after making my big move. I liked it well enough, and the insight into analyzing introvert behaviour was fairly interesting. But honestly, for the most part, this book just felt like it was preaching to the choir, about how awesome and helpful introversion is. It tends to conflate a lot of psychological aspects and concepts with a generalized sweep without really delving deep into them. Ultimately, it really feels like a narrative that‚Äôs just self-affirmation for introverts. Which I guess is not all bad

3. The Ancestor‚Äôs Tale by Richard Dawkins: I‚Äôve always been a huge fan of Dawkins and evolutionary science in general, and this book to me, is his masterwork. It‚Äôs painstakingly detailed look at 4 billion years of evolution through certain ancestors that‚Äôs structured like the Canterbury Tales. It‚Äôs a little different from Dawkins‚Äô other books in that it‚Äôs a bit more technical and maybe not as friendly to the layperson ‚Äì and also missing his trademark snark and cynicism (whether that‚Äôs a good thing is up to the read). But it‚Äôs incredibly enlightening and informative, and even eye-opening.

2. The First Three Minutes by Steven Weinberg: If you have any interest in astronomy and cosmology at all, then this book is a must-read. It‚Äôs fairly old, written near the end of the 70s, but aside from missing the discovery of dark matter, it‚Äôs still very much relevant and probably the best encapsulation of the big bang and the beginning of our universe you can find. It straddles the line perfectly between being appropriate for a casual reader and someone more academic

1. Endurance by Alfred Lansing: Boy did I pick the perfect book to read while living in a cold, remote landscape. Endurance is without a doubt one of the most thrilling, intense stories of survival I‚Äôve ever read. You come away with awe and respect at not only the courage, determination and perseverance of these men, but also at the sheer unfeeling power of nature itself. Some of the events and twists are so crazy that it feels like the contrivances of a Hollywood director ‚Äì in the best way possible. Lansing captures everything with some truly mind-boggling amount of research from primary sources, and creates an incredibly entertaining ‚Äì and scary - narrative

**Fantasy:**

6. The Shadow Rising by Robert Jordan: This was the only DNF book for me out of my entire list. I had read Eye of the World and The Great Hunt before, and I did a quick summary read-through of those two books to catch me up on the third book. I remember finding the first two books flawed even when reading them as a teenager but tried to give the series another shot. It‚Äôs a no go, to be honest. I just can‚Äôt over how weirdly juvenile and archaic all the characters and their interactions are. It borders on being cringeworthy and Jordan‚Äôs understanding and writing of female characters is just baffling. The plot just seems like more of the same. Bad guy of the week needs to be stopped by motley crew of magically powered teenagers. I‚Äôm calling it quits on Wheel of Time for good 

5. Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson: I read the first book of Stormlight a few years back and thought it was alright. Have seen rave reviews of WoR and decided to give it a shot and honestly came away really underwhelmed. There are some cool ideas for worldbuilding here but I don‚Äôt really find Sanderson to be a good writer at all. Aside from the wooden prose, the characters just come off as shallow, fantasy archetypes and the plot is both convoluted and nonsensical at the same time. Too much time is spent on explaining how powers and magic works ‚Äì which I also found to be an issue with the first book. I can see the appeal of these books for younger readers as they basically are like spectacle-filled action movies, but they are not for me

4. Red Rising/Golden Sun by Pierce Brown: I read these back to back because they‚Äôre fairly quick, easy reads. These are essentially mindless action movies in book form and they were a pretty nice change of pace as I needed something lighter after Wolf Hall. The character is a total Gary Stu, the dialogue is ridiculous and the story is crazy over the top. But yeah, it‚Äôs pretty fun, can‚Äôt deny that

3. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susannah Clarke: Man, this book might have taken me the longest out of everything I read in the past year, and there were times when I was contemplating dropping it. I‚Äôm glad I persevered though because I eventually came to love it. It‚Äôs essentially a Victorian novel, written in that era‚Äôs style with almost scary accuracy, and a fantasy novel-of-manners. Once you get on its wavelength, you start to appreciate the writing and the beautifully immersive world with some fascinating characters. The footnotes are amazing and the slow burn really helps create a wonderful atmosphere that carries you through to the end

2. A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Le Guin: Man, Le Guin is on her way to becoming one of my favourite authors. This little book is beautiful and punches far above its weight in terms of ratio of size to content. It‚Äôs a small little thing, especially compared to a lot of the bloated doorstoppers common to the genre but for me, it contained more emotion and wisdom than 10 Jordans or Sandersons. Written in Le Guin‚Äôs clear yet elegant prose, it has a fairy-tale-esque melancholy atmosphere, as if it‚Äôs a story you‚Äôre being told in front of a fireplace by your grandfather or something. It‚Äôs a story of self-discovery and learning to accept the dark parts of yourself, all brilliantly written. Will be continuing with the rest of the series eventually

1. The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe: Preface ‚Äì I only read Shadow and Claw so far but holy shit. What a book. Mysterious, mystical, weird, beautiful and often frustrating ‚Äì BotNS is unlike any fantasy I‚Äôve ever read. It probably has the most gorgeous prose I‚Äôve ever come across in the genre, and the usage of allegory and metaphor was really well done. The strange, dreamlike, almost surreal ambiance is what really stood out to me, and despite the obfuscations of the plot and the language, this still makes the book easy to get lost in

That‚Äôs it for my reviews/analysis! Let me know what you guys think of these books.

Except for the time she tried this with me.  I had actually given some thought as to what I would do if I was put in charge.

I walked up and stood in front of the black board  She gave me her piece of chalk, I guess expecting me to continue the math lesson.  But instead, I said ""It's time for recess.

I've been playing this game for a looooooong time and I can happily say that I still enjoy it a lot and more than any other game. However, there's something that I don't like and I think it's getting worse every year: **Events**. I want to prove my point by analyzing the evolution of events throughout the years. Just a heads up, League of Legends was released 12 years ago (!!!) so this is gonna be LONG (tl;dr at the end) and before anyone says anything, my shifts at work are way too long and I have a lot of free time. Please excuse any mistakes as English is my second language.

To make things simpler, I decided to divide my analysis in 5 parts (or eras) according to the characteristics of the game (and the events) at the time. Let‚Äôs jump right into it.

https://preview.redd.it/07vzcf0un8391.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f05be20e9565cbb9af89c5f2be79c88f6627e4

The game was in its beginnings and things were (rightfully so) simpler. The events from this era were characterized by event themed Summoner's Rifts. In the span of 2 years, we had:

* Winter Rift
* Winter Games Rift
* Christmas Rift
* Autumn/Halloween Rift

&#x200B;

[I can't believe a Winter Olympics event from 10 years ago has more in-game content than the current MSI 2022 High Noon event.](https://preview.redd.it/xxyxwjv2o8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a45ddb1142cd67e46d75738d802c93d888d775)

Every event also came with special runes, minion skins and new editions for consumables and items (and skins of course but that's the whole point of events: to sell skins so I'm gonna focus more on the additional features). While this might sound simple, I simply loved it? I live near the Equator so there aren't seasons around here but logging in to League and feeling the vibes of any of these events felt nice. I think immersion plays an important role in what events should be.

# Trivia:

* The last time we got the Autumn/Halloween Rift was 2011 (11 years ago)
* The last time we got the Winter/Christmas Rift was 2017 (5 years ago)
* We haven't gotten new versions for Items/Consumables since 2012 (10 years ago)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e1wzx847o8391.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=97cbc77b0cffe430474cf985d92bf5567600d2b3

All the things previously mentioned were removed for this period. So what was new? Well, Riot introduced ""Missions"". Missions as we know them today weren't introduced until 2017 but there were events where if you did X thing, Riot would send a reward to your account after a few days (similar to how they distribute ranked rewards nowadays).

&#x200B;

[Yup, FOMO has been here since the beginning.](https://preview.redd.it/3huyhmceo8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67d843833452d77a3ca97a6ec248df873b9d3d6)

The most common missions were:

* Purchase RP
* Send a gift to a friend (the Gift Center was created)
* Playing with friends or in certain maps (Howling Abyss and Twisted Treeline)
* Purchase event content

The reward was an icon 100% of the time. Additionally, ward skins were created and you could equip them and were free to use throughout the duration of the event (this was later changed and you had to rent them for RP or IP/BE to use it).

I would say the highlights of this era were that lore and champion release events were introduced: [Freljord Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPBUcguEGAI) (choosing your tribe) alongside with the release of Lissandra and the rework of Trundle / Sejuani. Similarly, events weren't Rift-centric all the time and featured other maps/playstyles. Twisted Treeline became the Harrowing map and Howling Abyss became the Snowdown map. On top of that, the first ever game mode was created: [Snowdown Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzAqOr8hwaY) (1v1 or 2v2).

I'm sure not all of you agree but I will die on these hills: I hate the fact that most events revolve around Summoner's Rift in some way and that profit (skins/champ releases) comes first when designing events instead of focusing on expanding the lore and building an immersive experience with a strong/cohesive narrative (e.g. Akshan had more to do during the Ruination event than Maokai, Yorick, etc. just because they wanted to promote the new champion and they shoehorned him + a lot of other champions just to sell the skins). Let‚Äôs move on because everything related to the Ruination event has already been said.

# Trivia:

* The last time ward skins were available to use for free during an event was in 2014 during the Lunar Revel event. After that, you were able to purchase them from the store and use them permanently (8 years ago)
* Snowdown Showdown hasn't returned to the live servers since 2013 (9 years ago)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zradzmajo8391.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcc4eaf0553a46e760047395be91e262194b677b

While the formula stayed mostly the same, everything was improved and Riot decided to give players everything they wanted. During this period, the following game modes were released:

&#x200B;

* [Legend of the Poro King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdQXAvqh3a0)
* [Ascension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFIp2UOvT9E)
* [U.R.F.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=misAyNLuoQg)
* [Hexakill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOKOfQEmbf0) (moved to the Twisted Treeline)
* [Black Market Brawlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPZbY3ySHDI). Included new items and even some of them were added to the main game: Dead Man's Plate
* New Map: [Butcher's Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Tc0mQFMdg) (ARAM)

&#x200B;

[All things considered, I think this is the closest we got to perfection.](https://preview.redd.it/2n6yhpbno8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=922f012c48cce9066737fd29d822daf0a9144769)

Event Missions were diversified and rewards were improved. New missions included:

* Earn gold
* Get kills
* Win under X mins
* Play in X map and do X thing specific to this map (Poro King, Ascension)

Rewards stopped being only icons and now included IP (BE) weekends, XP boosts, mystery champions and in some cases skins. Additionally, [reactive icons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZavO1j8A4c) (Poros in Poro King/Finishers for URF) and announcer packs ([Gangplank](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Announcer/Gangplank)) were introduced. Finally, minion skins such as Pool Party/[PROJECT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm4GGvdLr2g) returned with exclusive [spawn animations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzRmrQCTHFY). Loading Screen Borders were introduced for purchasing a skin during its release week. Icons were 250RP and didn't include the border.

\-

I want to take a moment to talk about the Pool Party 2015 event ([Team Up Week!](https://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/06/red-post-collectionteam-up-and-pool.html)). I have never seen something similar since then and I don't understand why those kind of events aren't more common (the VS events come close but not really). It was an event in which the whole community participated together to earn points and unlock rewards. The only downside is that points were difficult to get (gifting friends, strangers or playing as a group of 5) and that's' why we weren‚Äôt able to get Pool Party Mundo.

&#x200B;

[This was awesome, except for the five-player premade party part](https://preview.redd.it/u2gx0qrvo8391.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=31f4bb107f232c4547d93a4336fe146e60cea2fe)

# Trivia:

* The Butcher's Bridge hasn't returned since 2019 (3 years ago)
* We haven't gotten a new announcer pack since 2018 (4 years ago)
* We haven't gotten finishers/reactive icons since 2019 (3 years ago)
* Out of all the game modes released during this era, URF is the only one that returns frequently nowadays

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jp1jxw9xo8391.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cdb010405247330d214ca208094db15e925ff86

The missions system that we have today was introduced but the challenges stayed mostly the same. Rewards were improved a little bit with the introduction of Hextech Crafting (icons, IP (BE), hextech chests, emotes, champion shards, wards and in some cases, skins). New announcer packs were released: [Pyke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz3R_XPy7lE), [Star Guardian Ahri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxObxB68Ny4), [Dark Star Thresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFrUun9YB7k), [Phreak & Kobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF5ioqQeziQ), [Odyssey Kayn](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Announcer/Kayn). Map accents and minion skins returned for [Snowdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eJ8JI-QpSU), [Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCz2d6ZGJg4) and [Lunar Revel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMbMTlJrcD8).

Rotating Game Mode queue is introduced. Every weekend a game mode would be made available to play for everyone. This wasn‚Äôt necessarily connected to any event. However, here's the list of game modes that were released as a part of an event:

&#x200B;

* [Star Guardian: Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXLuW4elRL0)
* [Hunt of the Blood Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79L4ptk2nU)
* [Dark Star: Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9bG_L-iIz4)
* [Doom Bots of Doom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bT3y-yGfWE) (the game mode was released in 2014 but wasn‚Äôt part of any event)
* [PROJECT: OVERCHARGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z_in54benI)
* [Odyssey: Extraction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVlCbXhWmdA)

&#x200B;

[Riot Games and predatory monetization practices, name a more iconic duo. Riot Games and farting on your employees' faces maybe?](https://preview.redd.it/9zxo5pazo8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdcaf59516d2e4bc1356505c122ecd81ae8f6ab4)

**Hextech Crafting, Event Shops, Tokens and Passes are introduced.**

This is where things get complicated. As I mentioned before, missions and their rewards stayed mostly the same. However, a new event currency was introduced: **Tokens**. Every event had their own currency and some of them even had special chests which could give you a different (and more ‚Äòspecial‚Äô) currency for the same event. You could use the tokens or the ‚Äòspecial‚Äô currency to unlock additional exclusive content (icons, emotes, chromas). This sounds familiar, right? Well, we didn't have passes as we know them today and the only way you could get additional tokens was by buying orbs/chests bundles or by buying the pass (not all events had it and it only unlocked an exclusive mission track to earn a limited amount of tokens (+ bonus content); it wasn‚Äôt possible to earn tokens indefinitely). The loading screen borders were also included as exclusive content or in bundles and they weren't awarded for purchasing the skin during its release week. It's worth mentioning that events had free missions with tokens as rewards but you could only use them to unlock one icon/chroma most of the time, if you wanted anything else you had to buy the bundles or the pass. Here are some examples:

[Riot really loves to give their players ways to show their pride and accomplishment, don‚Äôt they?](https://preview.redd.it/67wx0t64p8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eed2244b0cf3b097defd78c483d16decbba2462)

IMO, this is where things started to go downhill. They gave us some of the best game modes ever but at the same time they introduced the predatory and FOMO fueled event system that we have nowadays. I'll go into more details at the end.

# Trivia:

* Not a single one of these game modes have returned since 2018 (4 years ago)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/35i9o4m7p8391.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bfda3f104249a49ad976a0bfba794bcc6382474

Do I really need to explain anything? This is what the first and latest pass got/get you when buying it:

[4 orbs, 200 tokens and 1 icon vs. 4 orbs and 200 tokens. The icon was moved to the mission track.](https://preview.redd.it/bbkxkjd8p8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=895a8653c3f961ab1350a702555ae27be4bf3c72)

This is what you could/can get in the event shops:

[Prestige Skin, Orbs, Champion Shards, Emotes, Icons, Wards and Chromas. Keys and Blue Essence were lated added.](https://preview.redd.it/d37a4z9ap8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd58479a3fb2d9bfd0741f93d948607315077d4)

However, not everything is as bad as it seems and you gotta give credit when it is due. I believe the first event only gave tokens as rewards of the missions and it was hard to get tokens. The mission track of today's events is more diverse and you always get:

&#x200B;

* 1500 tokens (purchasing pass, free and paid missions)
* 25 mythic essence
* 3 emotes
* 1 random emote
* 2 icons
* XP Boost for 10 wins
* 3000 BE
* 1250 OE
* 2 orbs
* 3 Masterwork chests (with keys)
* Eternals capsule

Half of these things I don't care for but it's something? For better or worse, the missions requirements and token gains have been tweaked a lotl. I'm glad you're not required to kill Baron as Yuumi to complete a mission anymore /s but the points/time required to complete them still feel like a punishment. Token gains were nerfed and I don't care how many times it is stated that the system is better or hasn‚Äôt changed at all, it's more difficult to get tokens nowadays and that's why I decided to not buy passes anymore.

[Can I copy your homework? Yeah just change it up a bit so it doesn't look obvious you copied.](https://preview.redd.it/0jyujvefp8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b16c68a63221c6c43e1ecc548339f15ac38362)

So how would I describe events nowadays? **Boring**. Here's a pass that will always get you the same, a prestige skin that you might want to grind for, icons (+borders), chromas and sometimes emotes/wards. Just a heads up, you won't be able to get everything because you're not supposed to. However, if you really want it you can always buy more RP. What about map/minion changes? You only get those when Riot's not busy looking for more ways to monetize the game (spoiler: never). And game modes? Here's (A)URF and One for All for the fiftieth time in the past year. Did you know they used to have a team focused on creating game modes? I put that in the past tense because based on what they've put out recently it looks like there isn't one anymore (I hope so, otherwise that would be sad). You know what's even sadder? Riot agrees. Here are the trailers for the last couple of events (90% of the content they use to promote the event is something you have to pay for. It‚Äôs funny how they try to sell the icons/chromas/borders as something game-changing):

[Wow. Look at all those things you can buy. What an \\""event\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/kihvr41kp8391.png?width=1654&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b86dc14a07c9e0c2835ba4a64d815118e1098c0)

# TL;DR / Conclusion

**Events in League according to Riot Games:** buy the skins, buy the capsules, buy the event pass, buy the chromas! In other words, if you do not pay for those things, you are not participating in the event at all and that is lackluster. You know what‚Äôs even worse? If you buy the pass, you will probably still miss like 70% of the content because of how grindy it is. League of Legends has one of the worst pass systems I‚Äôve ever seen. If you buy the pass in Fortnite, you can basically buy the next one for free and unlock like 5 skins with all of their additional content. But sure, let‚Äôs make it fairer and compare League‚Äôs pass system with Riot‚Äôs other games: TFT and Wild Rift. Are they grindy? Yeah, but you‚Äôre able to unlock all the content and you get: arenas, little legends, skins, finishers, etc. There's no token/event shop BS.

I‚Äôm just gonna use this gif to explain how I feel about (A)URF/One for All being the only event game modes (I know they‚Äôve [explained](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-pl/news/dev/ask-riot-new-game-modes/) why they don‚Äôt bring any other game modes back but bear with me.)

# What I think events should be:

95% of the time events are made to sell AU skins, the other 5% is to also sell skins but related to the lore. An event should be the exploration of the universe you‚Äôre trying to sell. As a player, things like Invasion or Extraction took me to that world and made me love it. I was immersed in those universes. Let‚Äôs be real, the first batch of Odyssey skins wasn‚Äôt that great (except for Kayn and maybe Ziggs) but everything was just so GOOD that I don‚Äôt care, I love every single one of them.

Game modes should be related to the event as well. I want to experience a demon-infested wild west, battle Mordekaiser in the PROJECT universe. I know other game modes have low play rates (especially on second runs) and that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt returned. But hey, not every game mode has to return or stay up permanently. It looks like if it‚Äôs not something Riot can bring back 20 times, then it‚Äôs not worth it for them to greenlight. They have the money, they have the resources and other companies also do it with no problem so I don‚Äôt see why it isn‚Äôt possible. Shootout to the Spirit Blossom, the 10th year Anniversary and Arcane events. They tried something different for the most part and even revamped some aspects of old events (e.g. Nexus Blitz). Ultimate Spellbook was the only redeeming quality of the Ruination event which tried to replicate the success of the Spirit Blossom one and failed miserably.

Finally, exclusive content is okay but it sucks when most of the content is locked either behind a paywall or a 30 day grind (and you still aren‚Äôt able to unlock everything). I play LoL to have fun, it loses its purpose when it starts to feel like a full-time job. It shouldn't be called an event if most of the player base is not able to engage with it in a meaningful way (community-wide events were awesome!!) and the paid content shouldn't be the primary focus of the events. If the experience is amazing, the skins are going to sell like hotcakes with no problem.

\-

Unfortunately it looks like things aren't going to change anytime soon and the only update that will come out soon is the third part of the mythic content overhaul (pictured below). So what's gonna change? Nothing. They're just gonna move everything to an event hub and things will be easier to find/visualize but the mission track/ event shop will stay the same:

According to court records, Walker told the judge this began as a ‚Äúrandom, innocent accident.‚Äù He was leading a youth group at a church-sponsored lock-in when the victim ended up sleeping next to him. Claiming he believed she was his wife, he began ‚Äúrubbing her‚Äù and didn‚Äôt figure out she wasn‚Äôt his wife until the morning.

None of that explains why the abuse continued long after that, or why several other girls who were teenagers in his church at the time said he was also sexually inappropriate with them.

341,Maintenance guy at senior living center gets revenge on satellite TV companies. Over 200+ residents emerge victorious!,147,ProRevenge,31214,0,1654179373.0,,v39v7h,<function Submission.id_from_url at 0x7ff321b94310>,False,True,False,,1,False,2600,https://redd.it/v39v7h,False,False,1245108,public,12,0.96,some_ads,False,/r/ProRevenge/comments/v39v7h/maintenance_guy_at_senior_living_center_gets/,"I'm the maintenance director at an independent senior living center. It's pretty much an apartment complex in which you have to be a senior citizen to reside. We provide three meals a day, house keeping, activities, a bus for transportation, and several other amenities to increase the quality of life because more times than not, they will spend the final years of their life here.

Our facility is family owned and orientated, family members of current employees are encouraged to apply for positions. We have one rule in our employee handbook; Ensure resident safety, happiness, and prolongment of life.

I take my job very seriously and take pride in it. I try to go above and beyond to make them all happy.

Each resident during the daytime either listens to the radio, play crossword puzzles, or most of the time watch their favorite TV shows.

We do not provide television service, each resident has to provide it themselves, if they choose.

Over the last year there has been a trend of televisions not working in countless units and when this happens they are very upset.

When I get a work order for a TV, I go and check it out. Most of the time there is nothing I can do. If the cable isn't cut, everything is plugged in, and there in no obstruction to the satellite signal, it's going to be a software issue.

When this happens I install an air antenna until their regular service is fixed.

I can the company and a tech comes out, fixes it, and usually within a couple hours it stops working again.

This is a never-ending cycle of upset residents.

Over the course of an entire year I spoke with several supervisors and tried to schedule for someone to come out and go through the entire property with me to address each issue.

They weren't having that. They wanted me to go to each individual unit and have that particular resident call them. This is almost impossible.

A lot of them have trouble hearing and discussing complex matters over the telephone, let alone know the four digit code and the answer to the secret question.

One resident was out of service for over 60 days and I demanded that they refund or discount this particular resident properly. They ended up only giving her $21 off, which isn't even half of a single months payment.

When I spoke with this particular representative I told them that wasn't enough and I would be throwing all of their dishes in the dumpster.

This is just the tip of the iceberg.

These companies have caused significant property damage to the facility. They've ran the coax in the gutters and down the downspouts. Ran cables draped over the sidewalk which is a tripping hazard. Installed dishes in the center of courtyards and wherever is convenient for them. All over the property cables ae strung out on top of the grass for hundreds of feet, they don't bother to bury any cables.

I have discussed this numerous times with the owner of the facility of the last year. The last time I spoke with him about it, he gave me the okay to handle the situation and do whatever needed to be done to fix the issue.

My options were limited and the only feasible option I could concoct was using a land line company that didn't need a satellite dish.

Well, I have officially finished running new coax to every single unit and a landline company as came in and installed boxes and services in each residents apartment.

Residents who have previously had to pay a monthly fee for their television service now get their service free of charge, those that never had service now do.

We have saved over 50 residents money every month and all in total over 200+ now have television service that is included in their rent without any increase whatsoever.

This was revenge for the representative talking to Miss T in such a negative and rude tone.

I couldn't be happier for my residents.

Our senior citizens are some of the most precious things we all enjoy, they hold all of our wisdom.

343,Chemo starts in 5 days and I thought I'd provide an update on my golf cancer trip and how ridiculous this community is.,118,golf,23512,0,1654187075.0,,v3cpa9,<function Submission.id_from_url at 0x7ff321b94310>,False,True,False,,0,False,1736,https://redd.it/v3cpa9,False,False,481747,public,20,0.96,all_ads,False,/r/golf/comments/v3cpa9/chemo_starts_in_5_days_and_i_thought_id_provide/,"So far, I‚Äôve had cancer return 5 times, 5th occurrence being a few weeks ago. Funny enough, my brain never gets used to hearing it‚Äôs got an expiration date. As soon as those dreaded words land, the first reaction is ‚Äúfuck‚Äù accompanied by the butterflies stampeding through my belly. Immediately after, in creep the images of my two little sons crying at night calling for dada and dada is chillin inside an urn in the garage next to unused sleeves of Kirkland balls. 

But then, rationality prevails and, after feeling sorry for myself enough, I start thinking about the things I can do. Obviously, my family and the treatment are my first considerations. My wife and boys to be safe and to get on the most potent poison they got in hopes of once more eradicating this thing. Then, personal desires come into play, which is what brought me to you guys a couple of weeks ago to ask for advice on where to play before my chemotherapy starts again.

If I were to speak about every kind message, interaction, or gift I received, we‚Äôd be here all day. The selflessness, generosity, and kindness displayed by this community is not only heartwarming and comforting, but it stands in stark contrast to what most folks perceive golf to be about. The community here can scold you if you don‚Äôt hit your drives 320+ but find yourself in a foxhole and everyone shows up.
I‚Äôd like to emphasize again that, while I was blown away and eternally grateful to you guys, my intention was never to benefit from my posts or my illness. Yet, I can‚Äôt help but feel that I benefited too much.

In addition to hundreds of messages (which I‚Äôm still responding to) and displays of generosity, this whole thing snowballed into something I could have never imagined.

In short, I ended up being a guest on a [Golf Group Therapy podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6ELdSE3bOMrrXBM3i7sGhb?si=7cb6aab721a5422c) where we talked dying and chunking wedge shots. This was followed by an [article in GolfWeek](https://golfweek.usatoday.com/2022/05/25/golf-cancer-facing-terminal-diagnosis-milos-bogetic-pinehurst/) that spread across the internet. The crown jewel of the entire experience, however, was an invite from an incredibly kind redditor to play Pinehurst courses. There will be a Pinehurst produced video too featuring your guys' comments!
 
Folks, Pinehurst indebted me forever. What started off as a couple of Reddit messages with a redditor who works there ended up with my family driving up to NC, staying at Pinehurst Resort, and playing the best courses that America has to offer. I was given tee times for #2, #3, and #4. I was given a caddy who caddied for Tiger, Rory, and Daly, amongst many others. To hear him tell stories of these legends who walked the same fairways as I felt very much like I was in a fairy tale. I 2-putted and heard a story about Daly sinking a 10ft putt with one hand and with a hot dog in his mouth. Hell, I had two videographers follow me while I played #4. You know what‚Äôs crazy? Here I am, 6 months into golf, barely grazing it under a 100, and all of a sudden, I‚Äôm walking Pinehurst courses with drone cameras and hall of fame caddies. Yes, I shanked plenty in 4K. The best time I‚Äôve ever had. Scored 3 pars on #2! Cart girls were hitting on me because they thought I was famous with my height + cameras. They moved on soon after I chunked my 3rd shot. We walked into our room to be welcomed by a hand-written letter and a bag of Pinehurst goodies. At the first tee, the director of golf presented me with an engraved Pinehurst medal and a Pinehurst flag signed by all the staff. I cried on the first tee boys, and I never cry over dying. Still hit a 190 yard bomb off the tee.

Here's the absolute honesty: walking these magical Pinehurst fairways caused an internal conflict, or war rather, of emotions. On one hand, it‚Äôd be every golfer‚Äôs dream to have this experience, let alone only 6 months into the game. I remain speechless at the opportunity I was given. On the other hand, such an outpouring of love really sobered me up to how serious my situation is. Pristine fairways, Tiger‚Äôs caddy, and getting par on #2 only come when attached to a terminal prognosis. Yet that wasn‚Äôt enough to even so much as put a dent into my experience there. I was truly happy.

I couldn‚Äôt play all the courses you guys so generously invited me to, at least not at this time. Heavy chemo starts next Tuesday, and I‚Äôll soon be walking around with a pump that‚Äôll so kindly be pushing poison into me. While my doc holds hope that I‚Äôll be able to sneak a round or two in during this period, my experience with these infusions suggests the opposite. I‚Äôve played 33 rounds this year so far, and I‚Äôm hoping to push that to 50 before the chemo truly kicks in, which is likely in some 3 weeks. There‚Äôs a Hail Mary clinical trial that we‚Äôre working on to see if I qualify, but when you start considering Hail Marys, you‚Äôre likely to soon meet Mary‚Äôs son.

Guys. You all have made this sticky situation infinitely better. Hell, you‚Äôve poured Goo Gone with a firehose. In my 6 years of flirting with the afterlife, I‚Äôve never felt such warmness from people. For a bunch of strangers spread across the planet to come together and offer help and tee times to someone like me is ridiculous. And to think, I kept refusing to get into golf because of its exclusivity and pretentiousness. 

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/v3cpa9/chemo_starts_in_5_days_and_i_thought_id_provide/

[My (26M) former FWB (28F) was hiding she's married, should I let her husband know?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v19i2z/my_26m_former_fwb_28f_was_hiding_shes_married/)

TLDR; I was FWB with a girl, she ghosted, now I find out her real identity and that she's married. Should I tell her husband about it?

We met on tinder, were seeing each other just for sex for about 2 months, then she disappeared without a trace.

The other day friend introduces me to her friend and her husband, and I see that girl, with terrified face expression as I approach and intentionally greet her with fake name (she lied even about her name) before correcting myself and telling her real name...

Her hubby is already a bit suspicious, and he should be... if only he knew that we were meeting about a year and half ago and they're married for 5 years...

She's suddenly blowing up my phone again to just keep it shush but IDK... should I? I just ignored her so far...

What should I do? I feel like I should tell?

**UPDATE:** Thanks to everyone for support. I feel like telling him is the right thing to do and you just confirmed it. I already told my friend about it and shown her our texts before and also her asking me to keep it silent now, and my friend also thinks I should speak. I have everything ready, I sent the guy friend request on FB (barely found him). I however plan to do it IRL if he is willing to meet with me.

**UPDATE:** She just called me at work! Long story short, he mentioned her my friend request, and she apparently admitted to him that we have something from past over the text and said that is why I'm trying to talk to him. Now he apparently left home early and will wait for her to come home tonight...

She also apologized to me and told me she understands my decision.

My friend will later verify how many of this is true... and I'll keep you updated!

**FINAL UPDATE!:** The guy accepted my friend request and sent me his number telling me to call him. And I did!

He wanted to verify what she told him. She told him it was year and half ago, but she also claimed that we had one time thing when she was pretty drunk and vulnerable, which he feels is a lie.

I told him it's not the case, and I told him it lasted for around 2 months, and that I can prove it too. To which he got emotional and said they never had issues but he often felt something is off. He had that feeling all along but was even upset at himself for doubting her and not trusting her more...

He hung up when he started to cry, I sent him the evidence of this lasting for way longer than just once and that she wasn't drunk at all. He thanked me for it and asked me to please send him EVERYTHING no matter how nasty it is because he may need it for divorce process. He made his decision and will be leaving her.

And he confirmed me they didn't have issues and weren't broken up while it lasted, as some of commenters here claimed.

He would probably forgive her, but it hurt him that he would have never know about it if I wasn't reaching out to him. Then another thing is that she still didn't give him full truth, she lied to him yet again. She even asked him to block me so they can ""move on from this"" after which he got conclusion that he really should talk to me. And after talking to me he said he even doubts I was the only one she cheated with.

Most heartbreaking for him is in his words ""my wife's sidepiece cares about me more than my fucking wife who I knew since I was 9yo""

edit: Apologies for my misunderstanding of how the spoiler tag worked.  This contains spoilers for **Rime of the Frostmaiden.**  Continue at your own risk!

We've been playing through **Rime of the Frostmaiden** now for several months.  We finally encountered (one of?) the Duergar Big Bad, Zarderok, and confronted him in his Forge.  The Forge room is a large hall with high ceilings.  Surrounding the forge area are a half dozen short towers with Duergar guards behind the battlements.  In the middle, just offset to the west is a large forge, glowing with heat and radiation heat across the entire room.  From underneath the forge, lava flows through a trough alongside several anvils.

We five accompanied by a handful of Duergar rebels who want out from under the fist of this Duergar boss.  We are a party of Sorcerer, Monk, Druid, Thief, and myself, a Cleric.

We kick open the door to the Forge and rush in.  We have a moment of surprise attack.  I call out the secret phrase that lets the few rebel Duergar in the room know that we're on their side.  Much scuffling between good guys and bad guys Duergar ensues.

We spot the Big Bad at the other end of the hall, alongside his second in command, and a short platform covered with a large tarp.  As we engage, we get a round or two of ranged combat in before the real battle starts.  The Duergar guards and rebels fight on, with Duergar Resistance Fighter #11 earning his place in Valhalla by single-handedly taking out three (or was it four) Duergar guards while mortally wounded before finally being dispatched himself.

Shortly after spells are arrows are exchanged, the Big Bad raises his left fist, on which he is wearing a red gauntlet.  He says a word and a beam of heat begins to emanate from the forge, slowly rotating its way across the hall.  As combat continues, and the heat ray slowly marches across the room, a couple of our Duergar rebel friends get fried to a crisp.  We the players manage to find shelter, either on top of the towers, or by hiding behind areas of the room that the heat beam cannot directly hit.

This gets frustrating as neither side can do much with the heat beam bisecting the room, the Big Bad can only cast ranged spells, and we can only use ranged spells and weapons that are on the verge of being too far away to accurately hit.  Our druid casts Dispel Magic on the glove, which causes the heat beam to turn off.  We try to close on the Big Bad, but he re-activates the heat beam before we can get close enough to melee.

At one point, I've forgotten how exactly, the heat beam is disrupted again.  I forgot who did what because I'm too excited to pull off my next move now that we're not pinned down again.

I'm low on the initiative order, but I still manage to get my move in before the heat beam can be reactivated.  I march towards the forge, catch the Big Bad's eye to make sure he knows I'm about to do something incredibly stupid and awesome.  While staring him down, I raise my hand, cupped like I'm holding something in it.  I then turn my hand over, say a holy word, and cast Create Water to dump 10 gallons of fresh water directly under the forge.  DM asks ""Are you sure you want to do this?  You've seen what happens to a steel foundry when water gets in, right?""  I say ""F yeah I do.""

The forge explodes into lava and shrapnel that scatters across the entire room.

The Big Bad staggers, his Second in Command staggers, both having failed their saving throw to avoid explosion damage.  The Second is nearly dead, the Big Bad is in seriously bad shape.  A couple of our party members also fail their save to dodge and take a lot of damage, but somehow, nobody quite goes down.  I fail too.  But because my DM is awesome, and I am awesome, I get inspiration, which I use to reroll my save, and make it this time.

The forge is now scrap, the heat beam is permanently gone, the Big Bad is seriously wounded, and now we can engage in melee, especially our jerk monk who loves to dart in and killsteal, which I'm hoping he'll manage to pull off this time.

Session ends.

And that's how I tried to TPK my group just to get the bad guy, using a first-level, non-offensive Cleric spell.

This is exactly what the whole Luna 2.0 situation feels like. People lost millions and now they are investing in a shitcoin in the hope to get that millions back.

*But there was an airdrop!? So they don't invest?!*

Yea, but in order for the coin to be worth something, other people will have to invest and put money into it, and there are people that are actively doing so. These are most likely the same people that already were invested in Luna before and want to make more gains to cover their losses.

But they are gonna lose all of it.

I even saw [someone getting it tattooed and claiming the design was theirs](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/oksech/newest_tattoo_of_rava_and_vatu_as_the_koi_fish/), even if you could easily look up in google ""raava vaatu tui la"" and mine would pop up in multiple of my shops, like redbubble, teepublic and spreadshirt.

Today while talking to a friend about how I've gotten that design stolen and proving my point, I googled it, and saw a swimsuit. Upon further inspection and reading the caption I came to learn that it was used for the [Mexican team swimsuit design for the olympics of last year](http://www.nickalive.net/2021/08/mexicos-synchronized-swimmers-paid.html), my name nowhere to be found.

I even [found a post talking about the swimsuit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/owgygl/another_avatar_reference_in_the_olympics_the/)!

This is just so upsetting to me as a fan and small artist, getting taken advantage of and getting no credit, while they get all the exposure for stealing someone's idea. Not even getting inspired, outright replicating it. I would have been so thrilled if they had simply asked for permission, but they didn't. I've even gotten inquiries about getting it tattooed and got asked if they could pay a fee for them to do so.

But this brand simply used it, free of charge, while I'm left with nothing in the dust, not even a mention of where they got it from, or ""inspired"" from. They get all the exposure and attention for something they didn't create themselves.

I don't even know if I can do anything at this point, so I'm just left with trying to bring awareness to this issue.

Edit: I am aware it's copyright infringement (extra edit: some people say it's actually not, and to be honest I don't really know enough about it to say if it is, or if it's not, so I'm not going to claim anything), but what bothers me is the fact that they did a literal copy&paste of something created by someone else, and didn't even bother to even tweak it (same fin design? Same position and flow?)

I am aware, this is a simple concept, but even so, nobody had created something similar before. At most, putting Raava and Vaatu in a yinyang formation.

I would have been fine with just credit, or at least asked beforehand, because they are indeed beautiful designs adapted wonderfully for a swimsuit.

&#x200B;

Since some people are talking about the tattoo, [here's a gif showing my design over the tattoo itself to clear that up a bit](https://64.media.tumblr.com/157bb5517a54e11bb1ab353dc1462ae3/882af3a4bf47ff3e-3e/s640x960/55f43fbb4ee721973a3ec11feed16ac7c4f30d4f.gif), it's not the main issue though.

&#x200B;

Edit: I wanted to clarify something, I didn't make this post to get clout and sales, or to go after them to sue. I made it because I wanted to bring attention to the fact that a design, created by a small fanartist inspired by something they loved, was blatantly used as it was, with no change, or significant change (making the fins less detailed to put shiny stones on them isn't derivative/transformative the same way as me reposting a song and changing a few musical notes wouldn't be transformative either) by a brand on an important event for everyone to see. The brand itself got mentioned, the show itself got mentioned, as for where they got the actual artwork? No mention.

It's the, being a brand and being able to do whatever they want with whatever they find on the internet, regardless of where it came from that I have an issue with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/v365ao/got_my_avatar_design_stolen_for_a_swimsuit_design/

Hello redditors. I‚Äôm Pali, Reddit‚Äôs Chief Product Officer. I joined Reddit last fall and now that I‚Äôve had some time to get settled, I‚Äôll share a few of the things Reddit is working on this year.

Let me start with my motivation for joining Reddit‚Äîall of you. Everyone who works at Reddit, including me, has the distinct privilege of serving an incredibly passionate and thoughtful community of people. People who engage in authentic and meaningful conversations, whether it‚Äôs in communities like [r/astrophotography](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/) or [r/cricket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/) (two of my favorites) or places like [r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/), [r/CasualUK](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/), [r/Eldenring](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/), [r/StarTrekMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekmemes/), or the open canvas and incredible diversity of [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). Together, these global communities have made Reddit *the* human face of the Internet. In my view, that's the magic of Reddit. And my team's mission is to do everything we can to ensure that the authentic, meaningful conversations that make Reddit what it is, continue to flourish as we bring Reddit to more people around the world.

To make that happen, this year the Reddit product team is focusing on empowering redditors and their communities. We‚Äôre prioritizing work around five key pillars‚Äîmaking Reddit Simple, Universal, Performant, Excellent, and Relevant‚Äîthese pillars will help us make Reddit [*SUPER*](https://i.redd.it/l9fzpvh7j9091.gif) for all of you.

# Simple

What shapes the Reddit experience are the features and tools that people interact with every day‚Äîthings like Reddit‚Äôs Home and Popular feeds, comment threads, search, or the moderation tools that keep communities running. Last year, we made huge strides toward [improving search relevancy and front-end design](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mharom/whats_up_with_reddit_search/), brought [new moderation features to the mobile apps](http://reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/nktza6/experimenting_with_a_new_mobile_moderation/), [iterated on custom avatars](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/), and even had time for a few fun projects like our [end-of-year Reddit Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/rbqu7c/reddit_recap_2021/). (Ngl, I‚Äôm really envious of everyone with more [bananas](https://www.reddit.com/r/polls/comments/rcyc2s/in_your_reddit_recap_how_many_bananas_did_you/) than me.)

But there are a lot of Reddit features that aren‚Äôt so easy to navigate. This year, we‚Äôre focusing on making Reddit easier and more intuitive by improving core features like onboarding, the home feed, post pages, search, and discussion threads.

**Creating easy ways to find communities and discussions**  
At the beginning of this year, the new [Discover](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/t0es8l/say_ahoy_to_the_discover_tab/) tab gave redditors an all-new way to find communities they might never stumble across in their Home feed or on r/popular, and last month [comments on Reddit became searchable](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/u3oz2x/whats_up_with_reddit_search_episode_vi_retrieve/), making it easier for redditors to quickly find conversations. But this is just the beginning. Other efforts this year will focus on better curation of communities, new live spaces for events like AMAs or livestreams, and a simpler way for new redditors to explore posts and curated recommendations so they can find communities about things they care about faster.

[Topic browsing within the new Discover tab](https://preview.redd.it/51wddomy49391.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d7e7485e77658f96e87f9a8409b710ac68fba9f)

**Improving the posting experience**  
Another series of initiatives will focus on making posting easier. A few projects in the works include:

* Highlighting a community‚Äôs post requirements and making it clear what post types are and aren‚Äôt allowed in different communities.
* Unifying Reddit‚Äôs post types so posters can do things like embed image galleries or polls in text posts and still have their post display nicely in feeds.
* And we‚Äôve also recently rolled out [Post Insights](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/tahpcx/creator_stats_performance_metrics_now_available/), a web feature that lets redditors see stats on their posts, which will be coming to the native apps.

[Surfacing post requirements while selecting a community](https://preview.redd.it/t5e7mta159391.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=7002f2584497bbb273e1995c6ddbfb41b187e8e9)

# Universal

As Reddit continues to grow into a platform people use all over the world, our teams will focus on building global Reddit experiences that support redditors from a diverse set of locations and cultures.

**Translating Reddit into more languages**  
We‚Äôve been working with redditors and moderators from outside the U.S. to translate Reddit‚Äôs user interface, and have already made Reddit available in French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), and Spanish (Mexico and Spain). As we continue to streamline our localization process, Reddit will be translated into more languages. And we‚Äôre also testing using machine translations so people can get quick translations of posts in their own language.

[Machine translation of posts](https://preview.redd.it/sc0p0h3459391.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=f03738dc4e455997e0b8960bd79eb88b7db8c496)

**Empowering communities around the globe**  
Creating an experience that‚Äôs truly local means much more than translating user interfaces. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre working with local teams to connect redditors to relevant local content and build communities that make sense for their location.

[Providing geo-relevant community recommendations during sign up](https://preview.redd.it/8ebg289f2a391.png?width=2926&format=png&auto=webp&s=c20378f49fc19cfe9b81e4091f9446309b508c67)

Part of that includes partnering with local moderators to build experiences that are authentic to their communities and cultures. And another huge part is making sure that our safety operations and machine learning efforts take into account the cultural nuances and differences of each new location.

# Performant

One consistent message from redditors has been that performance on the site and native apps could be better. We agree. That‚Äôs why the Reddit engineering team is working on making the Reddit platform faster and more reliable.

*A quick heads-up‚Äìthis section is for engineers and robots. If you like a bit of nerdy tech talk, read on. If you don‚Äôt want to get lost in the technical details of what it takes to keep a site likeReddit running, you may want to skip ahead to the ‚ÄòExcellent‚Äô section.*

**Improving platform stability**  
Last year, a major priority was improving feed load times (also known as Cold Start Latency) so that redditors could tap into their feeds and scroll through posts quickly, without waiting or watching little blue spinners tell them the page is loading. Because of those efforts, we saw drops in wait times across the board‚ÄîiOS went down -11%, Android -19%, and the backend was down -25%. We also made improvements that reduced crashes and errors, resulting in a 64% reduction in downtime and a 97% reduction in background error rate.We‚Äôll continue to invest in these sorts of latency and stability improvements, while also investing in a design system to componentize Reddit‚Äôs user interface (UI).

**Making Reddit** [**faster, faster, faster**](https://giphy.com/gifs/no-too-young-naive-u-think-that-mochi-thing-is-his-first-time-6Z3D5t31ZdoNW)**!**  
Another big factor in a webpage‚Äôs performance is how much stuff it loads. The number of requests for assets, the size of those assets, and how those assets are used are all good indicators of what sort of performance the site will generally have. Reddit‚Äôs current web platforms make a lot of requests and the payload sizes are high. This can make the site unwieldy and slow for redditors (especially in places that may already have slower internet service).

We‚Äôve already begun work on unifying our web (what some of you call new Reddit) and mobile web clients to make them faster, clean up UX debt, and upgrade the underlying tech to a modern technology stack. (For those interested in such things, that stack is Lit element, Web Components, and Baseplate.js. And the core technology choice is server-side rendering using native web components, which allow for faster page loads.) Stay tuned, because we‚Äôll be sharing more on these efforts later in the year, and there‚Äôs some exciting stuff on the way.

**Ok, so what about Old Reddit**  
Some redditors prefer using Reddit‚Äôs older web platform, aptly named Old Reddit. TL;DR: There are no plans to get rid of Old Reddit. 60% of mod actions still happen on Old Reddit and roughly 4% of redditors as a whole use Old Reddit every day. Currently, we don‚Äôt roll out newer features like Reddit Talk on Old Reddit, but we do and will continue to support Old Reddit with updated safety features and bug fixes. Of course, supporting multiple platforms forever isn‚Äôt the ideal situation and one reason we‚Äôre working on unifying our web and mobile web clients is to lay the foundation for a highly-performant web experience that can continue supporting Reddit and its communities long into the future. But until we have a web experience that supports moderators (which includes feature parity), consistently loads and performs at high-levels, and (to put it simply) the vast majority or redditors love using, Old Reddit will continue to be around and supported.

# Excellent

Reddit‚Äôs always been about the conversation, and more and more people are having live multimedia conversations with audio and video. To make Reddit more [*excellent*](https://media.giphy.com/media/vMnuZGHJfFSTe/giphy.gif) for you, we‚Äôre creating new multimedia experiences that creative redditors can use to connect, host events, and hang out.

**Evolving our live audio experience**  
Last year we piloted [Reddit Talk](https://www.reddit.com/talk) with a selection of interested moderators, and since then we‚Äôve seen communities host a variety of live audio talks about everything from [movie launches](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/si3u06/johnny_knoxville_and_chris_pontius_from_jackass/), and [dad jokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/s8wj1d/rdadjokes_open_mic_night_come_tell_jokes_with_us/) to [audio dramatizations](https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/u1lq70) and casual conversations within their community.

[Live comments and audience interactions in Reddit Talk](https://preview.redd.it/54ro1yha59391.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=c70d072593de833747dd42966060fdc644d13cdb)

While talks continue to catch on, we‚Äôve rolled out [new features](https://www.redditinc.com/blog/adding-new-features-to-reddit-talk-recording-function-web-experiences-comments-and-emojis-and-live-bar) to support hosts, such as the ability to record talks, a web experience, and listener reactions. After [chatting with moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/soi9hj/working_with_moderators_to_scale_reddit_talk_to/) who have hosted talks as well as redditors who attended them, we‚Äôre focusing on improving the audio itself, [letting moderators add approved hosts](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ulyqgq/adding_approved_hosts_to_reddit_talk_in_your/), and letting individuals host talks outside of communities from their profiles.

**Enabling real-time conversations**  
All over Reddit, communities are participating in real-time conversations. Whether it‚Äôs gameday threads during Champions League matches, heated debates during [the recent NFL draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ue7s60/2022_nfl_draft_day_1_discussion_thread_spoilers/), or discussions about a favorite TV show‚Äôs recent finale‚Äîacross Reddit, communities are using comment threads to communicate around live events related to their interests. To support this, we‚Äôll be focusing on improving and expanding how chat works on the site. We‚Äôre also working with moderators towards building out live chat posts within communities. This will give redditors new ways to engage, ranging from persistent general discussions, talks, and Q&As within communities, to more ephemeral chats that take place during live sporting events, breaking news, album releases, and more.

[Live chat posts within communities](https://preview.redd.it/chgy9q4i2a391.png?width=1463&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aa225832efeb95416386f83b0fa4aac01917f9e)

**Improving video creation tools**  
In 2021, redditors got a set of [new camera tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/svo77h/updates_on_reddit_talk_mod_tools_image_editing/) that included the ability to flip the camera or set a timer for recording, and editing tools like the ability to clip videos, add text, and export videos. Now we‚Äôre continuing to improve media posting and recently made updates to our image editing tools by adding the ability to crop, rotate, or markup images with text, stickers, or drawings.

[Markup and editing video creation tools](https://preview.redd.it/47ss77mf59391.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dedba3470f00f97aced8483d3d7e7ec77bc2f1c)

Of course, adding new creation tools is just one piece of the puzzle. This year we‚Äôll also focus on the back-end so that videos and images on Reddit load faster and more seamlessly. Which brings me to my next topic‚Ä¶

**Ok,** [**let‚Äôs talk about the video player**](https://media.giphy.com/media/1zk6v7m1Rz8ifqSH0C/giphy.gif)  
As we‚Äôve [talked about before](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/owjcoq/addressing_the_new_video_player/), we know the video player is still a work in progress. We‚Äôve heard your feedback and are working on a series of updates to address it:

* **Easier commenting**We‚Äôre refining the player design with features such as better comment integration and gesture parity to make it easier to watch videos while scrolling the comments. There are a couple of different ways to do this, but one solution we‚Äôre looking into is making a swipe right navigation that takes you to a video‚Äôs comments where you can watch a thumbnail version of the video while joining the discussion about it.
* **Improved performance**We‚Äôre also actively working to address bug and performance issues to support different video resolutions, reduce buffering time, and improve video caching.

# Relevant

In 2021, improvements to Reddit‚Äôs feeds, [such as the update to the default ‚ÄúBest‚Äù sort](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/o5tjcn/evolving_the_best_sort_for_reddits_home_feed/), helped more redditors discover and join new communities. From increased post views and comments, to a greater number of smaller subreddits seeing growth in subscriptions; [using Machine Learning (ML) to improve recommendation algorithms](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) has helped connect redditors to the communities and content they enjoy.

**Using ML in a way that makes sense for redditors**  
Something we talk a lot about in-house at Reddit but haven‚Äôt talked much about publicly before, is that the vast majority of people come to Reddit with intention, not for attention. That mindset translates to a lot of our projects, but while working on ML, it means we [evolve our algorithms and recommendation engines](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/q14tsw/evolving_reddits_ml_model_deployment_and_serving/) in a way that doesn‚Äôt merely optimize for engagement and attention, but for value‚Äîthe value Reddit‚Äôs content brings to individual redditors and their communities (both on-platform and in real life).

**A community-powered approach to ML**  
Reddit is powered by communities, and our algorithms are no different. Reddit runs on votes, and people see things on Reddit because they vote on them. An upvote or a downvote is an explicit signal that gives us constant and immediate feedback from the community. This year we‚Äôll continue to improve this community-driven model by incorporating more signals (both positive and negative), exploring more ways redditors can give direct feedback (such as ‚Äúshow me more/less of this‚Äù), and adding tests to better understand how different aspects of the model affect redditors‚Äô experience.

[Community-driven signals in feed recommendations](https://preview.redd.it/ylbetm1k59391.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab63d2344e6143c911e83aedd2ce5d55893c53e9)

# But none of this is possible without safety and moderation

To see the plans above come to fruition and to make Reddit truly [SUPER](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohs7S33U5cM3OSyL6/giphy.gif), our moderation and safety tools will also continue to evolve.

**Safeguarding Reddit communities, moderators, and conversations**  
Safety is foundational to everything we do and build at Reddit. As was outlined in our recently published [2021 Safety & Security Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/su8quu/q4_safety_security_report/), admins removed 108,626,408 pieces of content last year (27% increase YoY), the bulk of which was for spam and content manipulation (which is commonly referred to as vote manipulation and brigading). We also made updates to features that redditors have long asked for including [blocking improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/s71g03/announcing_blocking_updates/), the ability to [view and manage your followers](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/mz36uf/adding_the_ability_to_view_and_manage_whos/), and a new system that auto-tags content as NSFW.

Looking ahead, we‚Äôll focus on safety efforts in two main areas:

* Real-time detection and systems to help catch more policy-violating content such as spam and vote manipulation
* Developing more features that allow redditors to manage their safety‚Äîthis includes things like the ability to mute communities you‚Äôre not interested in so they don‚Äôt show up in your feeds, iterations on the recent blocking updates to address feedback we‚Äôve gotten, and new tools to help moderators and redditors to more easily filter out unwanted content.

**Providing moderators with tools and support**  
Moderators are a critical piece of the Reddit ecosystem, and a critical part of our job as a development team is supporting them by making moderating on Reddit as easy and efficient as possible. In 2018 we introduced the [Mod Council](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415446939917-Reddit-Mod-Council-)‚Äîan opportunity for mods and admins to have a two-way, ongoing dialog about features in development. Another important initiative is our [Adopt-an-Admin](https://mods.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421932319501-Adopt-an-Admin) program, where Reddit employees help moderate communities in order to better understand the mod experience first-hand. Most recently, we kicked off a series of Mod Summits to provide additional forums for feedback and conversation‚Äîand had over 600 mods join us to share their experiences at our last summit in March.

These ongoing conversations and programs have transformed the way we build and develop mod tools. And as someone who came to Reddit late last year, I was extremely impressed by the deep knowledge and expertise our moderators bring to the way we build products.

* **New mod tools**  
One recent project to come out of those conversations is a feature moderators have long asked for, [Mod Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/t8vafc/announcing_mod_notes/). Launched on the web last month, Mod Notes allows mods to leave notes with reminders for themselves and others about people‚Äôs actions in their community. Another feature we continue to iterate and expand with mod feedback, Crowd Control, has now been adopted by over 900 communities. And features we‚Äôre currently still working with moderators on include bringing removal reasons and Mod Notes to mobile and mod queue enhancements such as the ability to sort in new ways.

[Mod Notes on mobile](https://preview.redd.it/dxmsbwzn59391.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cb7f6c3ef149967188d718f30018ebdb61d3c53)

* **Addressing mod harassment**  
Another important mod initiative is our work focused on addressing mod harassment‚Äîpre-empting harassment where we can and making it easier to report when it occurs. Last year, the team focused on tools to reduce harassment in modmail, direct messages, chat, and custom reports. Now we‚Äôre building on this work by focusing on three main areas:

1. **Prevention**: Exploring tiered engagement permissions with features such as Crowd Control or approved users, as well as ways to better identify and handle ban evasions.
2. **Escalation**: Expanding reporting coverage to make reporting easier and more efficient.
3. **Responsiveness**: Improving how long it takes admins to respond to reports by streamlining our in-house tools to help our agents quickly and accurately make more informed decisions. This is work that will not only help mods, but also all redditors who are reporting policy violating content, and something we think will have a big impact on making the site safer.

# What‚Äôs next

There are also a few projects in the works we‚Äôll be sharing more about in the months ahead:

**Empowering communities**  
Late last year, we started experimenting with the idea of [Community Funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/ubq33x/announcing_the_community_funds_program/)‚Äîa program to help financially support community-driven projects that showcase the creative, collaborative, and generous spirit of redditors all around the world. During the pilot phase, we provided 13 communities with over $60,000 in funding that they used to host a [comics tournament,](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/q3pgx0/rcomics_tournament_announcement/) hold a [r/askhistorians digital conference](https://www.askhistorians.com/2021-digital-conference), create a [community-designed billboard in Times Square](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/rmxgl7/211223_announcing_permission_to_billboard_ptb_a/), and much more. We recently announced that [we‚Äôre pledging $1 million toward the Community Funds Program](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/ubq33x/announcing_the_community_funds_program/) to fund even more ideas. Through these funds, we want to continue empowering redditors to positively impact the world around them through the power of their communities. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the community comes up with.

**Working with third-party developers**  
There are a lot of passionate developers making great tools redditors and moderators use on the platform every day. Supporting and working with these developers will only make Reddit more extensible and make using Reddit better for everyone. This year, we‚Äôre exploring ways to support the creativity of third-party developers as they expand on the Reddit experience, while safeguarding the security and privacy of people on the platform.

**Making Reddit Avatars truly your own**  
Since launching avatars, we‚Äôve enjoyed seeing redditors use this fun, simple tool to represent who they are. The next step is exploring more ways redditors can make their avatar their own by making it easy to create your own gear, finding fun ways to represent redditors contributions, and giving people greater control over their avatar and online identity‚Äîeven beyond Reddit.

As I wrap this up, I want to say that this year is an exciting year for Reddit. We have an opportunity to bring Reddit to more people, and there‚Äôs a significant amount of responsibility in evolving a platform that‚Äôs become a home to so many people and communities. As stewards of this platform built and loved by all of you, we take that responsibility seriously‚Äîbut it‚Äôs really you, the Reddit community, who will determine what Reddit is and what it will be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/v3frc1/what_were_working_on_this_year/

I am currently working full time and flourishing in a hard science field and my parents aren't proud of anything I have become. I have a troubled relationship  with my mother as she often demands to be in my private space (demand to go through my phone, demands to have a say in every decision I make whether it is an outfit I wear or a career choice, Tries to control my investments and purchases now that I have an income) and yells and screams at me if she doesn't get her way. She does raise her hand to hit me occasionally. My father plays peacemaker and says she has my best interests at heart and generally tries to keep the peace.

Today I'm extremely hurt and upset and I feel betrayed...

There was a spat between my mother and I a couple of hours back and the reason was - I do not blindly obey and i always ""talk back"" by asking for a reason. This is pretty common with my mother as she does have conservative views on how women should behave and expects me to follow them. I always fight back. My father arrived on cue to diffuse the argument but sided with my mother and let loose these words - ""you are only free to do whatever you want only after you get married and even then only with the permission of your husband. Until then you must obey us.""
 
This has been been implied before by nosey relatives if I do not do the things expected of me but never explicitly stated like this. I'm posting here to vent my frustrations as I take full control of my life.

Today - I have decided to take these as fuel for change. I am giving up on the hope for happiness when my family is by my side. They do not value the same things as I do and will invariably villanise me for choosing to prioritise things in my life differently. I will instead grow to fill the world that has opened up without them looming over my future and fill it with WHATEVER I WANT. 

They will not be a part of my future. From now, I am  mentally surrounding them in a bubble exactly like our bodies surround a splinter that cannot be expelled. They will stay chained in my past and will not be able to harm my future. They simply will stay wherever I put them. They will hear about me being happy and prosperous, but they will never be a part of that future, my future. My life will be built in exactly the way I want and they will never share my happiness.

June 2nd, 2022 is the day the silent and obedient wife material they raised, died. I, their daughter,  have killed her to make space for the happiness I build for myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v31v0c/the_silent_and_obedient_potential_wife_my_parents/

Coming soon to public preview, we're rolling out several new classifiers for Communication Compliance to assist you in detecting various types of workplace policy violations.

This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID¬†93251,¬†93253,¬†93254,¬†93255,¬†93256,¬†93257,¬†93258

When this will happen:

Rollout will begin in late June and is expected to be complete by mid-July.

How this will affect your organization:

The following new classifiers will soon be available in public preview for use with your Communication Compliance policies.

Leavers:¬†The leavers classifier detects messages that explicitly express intent to leave the organization, which is an early signal that may put the organization at risk of malicious or inadvertent data exfiltration upon departure.

Corporate sabotage:¬†The sabotage classifier detects messages that explicitly mention acts to deliberately destroy, damage, or destruct corporate assets or property.

Gifts & entertainment:¬†The gifts and entertainment classifier detect messages that contain language around exchanging of gifts or entertainment in return for service, which may violate corporate policy.

Money laundering:¬†The money laundering classifier detects signs of money laundering or engagement in acts design to conceal or disguise the origin or destination of proceeds. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking or financial services who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for money laundering in their organization.

Stock manipulation:¬†The stock manipulation classifier detects signs of stock manipulation, such as recommendations to buy, sell, or hold stocks in order to manipulate the stock price. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking or financial services who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for stock manipulation in their organization.

Unauthorized disclosure:¬†The unauthorized disclosure classifier detects sharing of information containing content that is explicitly designated as confidential or internal to certain roles or individuals in an organization.

Workplace collusion:¬†The workplace collusion classifier detects messages referencing secretive actions such as concealing information or covering instances of a private conversation, interaction, or information. This classifier expands Communication Compliance's scope of intelligently detected patterns to regulated customers such as banking, healthcare, or energy who have specific regulatory compliance obligations to detect for collusion in their organization.¬†

What you need to do to prepare:

Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance helps organizations detect explicit code of conduct and regulatory compliance violations, such as harassing or threatening language, sharing of adult content, and inappropriate sharing of sensitive information. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are explicitly opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to ensure user-level privacy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/v3b2mn/microsoft_introducing_ways_to_detect_people/

Patch 1.14 for Horizon Forbidden West is now available. Take a look through the notes below, and make sure to update your game before jumping back into the world. Please also make sure to download Hotfix 1.15 when updating your game.

\*\* Please note that some patch notes may contain SPOILERS!\*\*

https://preview.redd.it/y0w2298v4a391.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6e0afd8299169c62e37896f31f97b34ed46c6c

We‚Äôre so thankful for our incredibly talented community and are happy to announce that this major update includes much-requested features, including:

&#x200B;

**FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS**

* Improved visual fidelity in Performance Mode.
* Multiple crash fixes.

**Main Quests**

* Fixed an issue in Main Quest  ‚ÄúThe Sea of Sands‚Äù where progression was blocked when trying to open the valve.
* Fixed an issue in Main Quest  ‚ÄúThe Broken Sky‚Äù where the quest would become stuck if the cinematic was skipped too fast.
* Fixed an issue in Main Quest ‚ÄúThe Dying Lands‚Äù where the quest did not progress after defeating the Grimhorn.

**Side Quests**

* Fixed an issue in Side Quest ‚ÄúBreaking Even‚Äù where the beams that need to be interacted with would not be present.

**World Activities**

* Fixed an issue where fast-traveling to Rebel Outpost: High Turning would send Aloy somewhere else.
* Fixed an issue where the campfire in Rebel Camp: Devil‚Äôs Grasp would remain unavailable after completing the camp.
* Fixed an issue where an objective would not be completed in Rebel Camp: The Hive
* Fixed an issue in The Arena where the timer would continue counting down after defeating all the machines.

**Datapoints**

* Oops‚Ä¶ Added World Datapoint 63, which can be found >!somewhere near the Widemaw site on the Isle of Spires.!<

**Machines**

* Fixed an issue where the Tallneck shockblast would destroy all other machines.
* Fixed an issue where the Fireclaw would not go into the Shocked or Knocked Down State when triggered during certain attacks.
* Fixed an issue where the Behemoth would be able to chain charge attacks in rapid succession.
* Fixed an issue where detached machine parts could fall through the floor.

**Humanoids**

* Fixed an issue where some weapons did not give Valor correctly.
* Reduced crafting costs for crafting Traps at a Workbench.

‚ÄúThese past few years have been rough.  I miss them all.   Ed Bryant, Michael Engelberg, Ben Bova, Phyllis Eisenstein, Victor Milan, Steve Perrin, Kay McCauley, Gardner Dozois‚Ä¶ ah, Gargy‚Ä¶ I know I am forgetting people.   They made the world a richer place, and we are poorer for their absence.‚Äù


He‚Äôs said similar things in previous blog posts. George seems to have been losing a lot of friends over the past few years he must be working through an awful amount of grief. He also talks about the Ukraine war and the recent school shooting and it‚Äôs clear that he isn‚Äôt feeling positive about the world right now. He might even be depressed. He knows we all are desperate for Winds and I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs eating at him too and how us as the fans treat him and view him certainly isn‚Äôt helping.

I know that it‚Äôs been 11 years but at the end of the day George is a human being and we need to stop treating him like he is simply a vassal for a song of ice and fire as opposed to a person. 

Instead of spamming ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Winds‚Äù we should be sending messages of support and love. George is taking his time but we have to be respectful and show him compassion, he is going through a lot right now and we need to remember that.


Also very hyped he name dropped a pov that he‚Äôs finally finished chapters for. Im sure once we read those ‚Äúclutch of Cersei chapters‚Äù we will understand why they were ‚Äúgiving him fits‚Äù and it will all be worth the wait.


Hope you all have a great day. Stay safe:)",https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/v3a5g5/spoilers_main_we_need_to_show_more_compassion_to/

Something I thought of recently:

I'd re-assign several classes to different groups in an effort to rescue the Sorcerer's identity:

* Make the Bard a 1/2 caster - a rogue / caster hybrid that gets skills and prof. bonus' lke a rogue and a selection of control spells. Maybe a non-damage charm 'smite' that makes them a control beast.  
* give Magical Secrets to Sorcerer and rename it. They're now a font of magic - who cares where this spell comes from? 
* Make Sorcerer a prepared caster - similar ot magical secrets they should be much less restricted in spell choice than a wizard who has to learn spells like some kind of nerd 
* Make warlock an Int class. There's too many Cha. classes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/v36qye/whats_the_most_radical_change_you_would_like_to/

The mood was pretty jovial, children laughing, birds singing... Then we got the news it was a 5 percent AP ratio and mana cost reduction on E and everything went to hell. Someone knocked the grill over and people just started screaming and crying. Then we heard it... Laughter. I don't know where it started but the crowd devolved into uproarious, maniacal laughter.

Tell me, do you know what EQ means? What it stands for? Sure, it could be a reference to Ryze's simplified EQ combo. But deep down Ryze players are actually using it as an abbreviation for ""extremely questionable"" in reference to the state of the champion. Every time someone says EQ it is a deep expression of pain and loss.

Ryze players are a dying race. All sane Ryze players have left long ago leaving a collection of confused and often deranged Runic people's just trying to win a game on summoner's rift, unwittingly participating in a twisted experiment to see how much mental anguish a playerbase can withstand before it actually collapses. R/RyzeMains is a window into our broken soul.

Are they that stupid?  Or are they that strong?  I feel like delver isn‚Äôt a career where stupid gets to live for long, but I also feel like the attacks they were trying to use to lure Poe down were kinda pathetic, too.

&nbsp;

Whatever the reason for their confidence, go time is truly upon them all.  With a caw and a powerful flap of his wings, Poe sends two groups of birds at the trio.  The flying blackness moves gracefully like a swarm of fish, moving at his command.

&nbsp;

The halfling raises her staff and stands tall on her wolf‚Äôs back as she shouts ‚ÄúEnthrall!‚Äù  Power bursts forth and sweeps over the ravens and crows as they near the group, but not a single bird falls out of line.  The three notice quickly, but not quickly enough to avoid the incoming pain.

&nbsp;

They all hunker down as best as they can as the mixed unkindness wreaks its namesake upon them.  The mass of black feathers soon soars back to the sky, leaving the trio covered in scratches and slashes.  The wood elf growls at his team mate.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúYeah, that worked great!  Got any other fancy spells to do nothing with?‚Äù

&nbsp;

She shouts at him in response.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see you do anything!  How was I supposed to know that scion would make them immune?  It worked on the wolf!‚Äù

&nbsp;

‚ÄúShut up, both of you!  If you haven‚Äôt noticed, we‚Äôre still in a fight!‚Äù  The troll glares at the two, who glare at each other, but soon have to focus their attention on Poe.  ‚ÄúMlynda, tornado.  Hark, fill it with pain,‚Äù the leader orders, and the two quickly follow it.

&nbsp;

Mlynda raises her staff again and quickly summons a small tornado, and her favorite person to yell at starts throwing his boomerangs into it.  It reaches some kind of tipping point as the next attack from Poe comes in, and the two shout.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúRazor Winds!‚Äù  The two do their best to keep the uncontained blender between them and the birds, but all three still take further scratches.  The two that love to argue are looking like they decided to wrestle with barbed wire, but the troll seems to be regenerating through the small wounds, mostly.

&nbsp;

The tide of feathers ebs once more, and before they can get a look at the aftermath, the wood elf is screaming.  If he wasn‚Äôt afraid of heights before, he probably will be once Poe decides to release him.

&nbsp;

___________

&nbsp;


**Poe**

&nbsp;

___________

&nbsp;

Poe had never understood why Aranya used to call the delvers ‚Äòdefilers‚Äô, but now he gets it.  If these were the first delvers Lord Thedeim had encountered, how different would he run his demesne?  The screams of terror coming from the delver in his talons brings his focus back; deal with the threat first, ponder theoreticals later.

&nbsp;

He would have been happy to continue to ignore the three until they got bored, but then their boredom found a new target.  The ratling will be fine once it respawns, but then they decided to threaten his Lord‚Äôs second Resident.

&nbsp;

While Lord Thedeim is still an enigma to all but Teemo, the other scions can still sense his moods.  While his presence is most-often soft and warm, a thermal to uplift, it became a storm-swept cliff when the troll advanced on her.

&nbsp;

It warmed slightly once she escaped, which is the only reason he‚Äôll soon be releasing the arms of his unwilling passenger in a few moments, rather than testing how high he can fly with such heavy prey.

&nbsp;

He snaps a sharp turn and releases the wood elf to gravity, and watches the sloped roof rush to meet him.  Belatedly, he sends a blunt gale to adjust the fool‚Äôs orientation.  Lord Thedeim prefers to not kill thinking delvers.  Poe isn‚Äôt so sure these ones match that description, but he‚Äôll err on the side of mercy.  It‚Äôs much easier to be less merciful to the living than it is to be more merciful to the dead.

&nbsp;

The elf grunts from the rough righting of his tumble, and Poe feels the attacker should be glad to only be likely to break a limb, rather than his neck.  He watches, taking satisfaction in the pained sounds as gravity introduces its new friend to all the interesting hard things the roof has to offer, before reuniting him with the ground.  The elf lies in a groaning heap as Poe takes a moment to inventory his state.

&nbsp;

Alive, no limbs broken, but likely a few ribs.  And a lot of other injuries besides.  He doubts the elf will be available to be introduced to any more of gravity‚Äôs friends for a while.  That just leaves the other two.

&nbsp;

___________

&nbsp;


**Thedeim**

&nbsp;

____________


&nbsp;

The other two watch as Poe takes off with their‚Ä¶ well I would say ‚Äòfriend‚Äô, but I think that‚Äôs a bit strong.  The Lord of Unkindnesses has a claw wrapped around each of his biceps as he takes off, after having used the cover of the flocks to slip in and snatch him up.

&nbsp;

I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll have to remind Poe to not kill him, but he releases the jerk barely before clearing the roof, not that he gives him a simple straight fall.  He hurls the guy at the slanted roof and slings a dense bit of air at him as well, slapping him around a bit before he bounces off the roof, the gutter, and several thick branches of a tree, before landing in a pile on the ground.

&nbsp;

I‚Äôm actually impressed.  That was a pretty thorough beating Poe laid down without killing the guy.  From the groans, he might have preferred that, but this group isn‚Äôt getting off that easily.

&nbsp;

Speaking of the group, it looks like they aren‚Äôt finished yet.  While Poe rallies his birds, the troll and halfling hatch their own plan.  She summons two of those thorny vine things and the troll uproots them, letting them sink into his forearms.  That‚Äôs gotta sting, but troll regen makes things like that an option, I suppose.  Mlynda has the vines take his swords, wrapping around the handles, and leaving Vnarl looking like a purple Kratos.

&nbsp;

Poe‚Äôs attack is different this time, too.  Instead of two wings of blackness sweeping in from two sides, it‚Äôs more like a single river of black going at them.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to give them the chance to recover between attacks this time.  That formation looks long enough that it can loop back in on itself and keep the pain going until the other two are as incapacitated as the first.

&nbsp;

The troll meets the onslaught head on, swinging vine and sword like this isn‚Äôt his first rodeo.  The halfling is crouched behind her wolf now, rather than standing proudly on top, shouting over the din of caws and ordering the vines to unleash their thorns.  Between the thorns and the steel, the river of black soon becomes just a stream, then a trickle, before it peeters out entirely.

&nbsp;

The two stand, grinning and exhausted, though not unharmed.  The halfling and her wolf are bleeding from so many scratches and slashes that I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre both actually in danger of bleeding out.  And they both look better than the troll.

&nbsp;

Where they have scratches and cuts, he has deep gashes and slices.  They‚Äôre deep enough that even his regeneration looks like it‚Äôs not going to be up to the job of keeping him in the fight for too much longer.

&nbsp;

He and the halfling laugh defiantly at Poe as he lands atop the porch to look at them.  It takes them a few moments to realize two very important things.  One: they haven‚Äôt gotten their boss experience yet.  Two: They can still hear a *lot* of cawing.

&nbsp;

The nearest wave of ravens and crows that were on expedition have been recalled.  The grins vanish at the realization, and Poe takes off once more, the Marshal of Murders not finished with his prey just yet.

&nbsp;

He flaps his wings, sending blades of wind to sever the vines, and the tired duo can‚Äôt protect them in time.  The cawing changes as Poe looks down on them, my raven scion opening his beak to clarify the chant from his lesser kin.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúAgain!‚Äù

&nbsp;

The duo can only stare at the oncoming wall of blackness, and deafening tide of ‚Äúagain‚Äùs.  Vnarl quietly speaks as they get closer.  ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a toybox‚Ä¶‚Äù  The halfling punches him in the hip before the blackness of feathers consumes them, and quickly leaves them in the blackness of unconsciousness.

Here is an updated megathread just in time for the Xbox and Bethesda Showcase!

**Xbox Game Studios:**

1. **343 industries**: Currently working on post launch content for **Halo: Infinite** and its planned 10-year roadmap for the future of Halo. A small team is working on continuous updates to **Halo: Master Chief Collection** such as new maps from Halo Online, armors, mod tools, and custom games browser for each of the games. Halo Infinite is set to have a Co-op mode release half way through its second season and Forge release in beta around the same time. Also developing and maintaining the Slipspace Engine. According to Window Central's Jez Corden, there is also a **New Halo Project** [distinct from Halo Infinite](https://youtu.be/tlhrbkhj0VY?t=11728) in development. 343i also [filed a trademark](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/halo-the-endless-trademark-filed-by-microsoft/ar-AAREQnA#:~:text=Halo%3A%20The%20Endless%20has%20been%20trademarked%20by%20Microsoft.,patent%20filing%20by%20Microsoft%20began%20circulating%20on%20Twitter.) for **Halo: The Endless**. Whether this is a DLC Campaign for Halo Infinite, a new game, or a book is unknown. The Beta build for the new Halo Waypoint had a reference to multiple campaigns leading people to believe that campaign expansions are likely especially since Halo Infinite was described as a 10-year title. **Certain Affinity** is also working on something new for Halo Infinite that might be a Battle Royale according to [Jez Corden](https://www.windowscentral.com/report-certain-affinity-working-xbox-exclusive-monster-hunter-codenamed-suerte) it is code-named **Project Tatanka and has been rumored to be the cross between Halo 5's Warzone and a Battle Royale with deep integrations into Forge.
2. **The Coalition**: Currently working on mastering UE5 according to a [Press Release](https://www.gears5.com/the-future-of-gears-5). The press release states they are working on ""multiple projects"" with one being confirmed to be the next **Gears of War**. According to [rumors heard Jeff Grubb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etwzaXHr0w0), he believes the smaller project to be a new IP on a smaller scale, though he does not know what the IP could be. He heard rumors of a Star Wars IP but was unable to confirm them. Jeff believes this **small IP** is set to [release in 2023](https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/13/xbox-bethesda-e3-2021-where-were-games-like-avowed-perfect-dark-and-fable/) and Gear Next after.
3. **Compulsion Games**: They are working on a Single Player, [3rd Person Action-Adventure](https://xboxsquad.fr/news/2021/09/xbox-game-studios-jeux-harcelement-notre-interview-exclusive-avec-naila-hadjas-de-compulsion-games/) game in mid development. The codename of the game is **Project Midnight** and is a Dark Fantasy title according to [Jez Corden at Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/new-upcoming-xbox-exclusives-project-midnight-compulsion-and-pentiment-obsidian). They recently moved to a new office and are planning to over double their staff.
4. **Double Fine**: Having recently released **Psychonauts 2**, it is unknown exactly what Tim Schafer will do next. There had been rumors of Banjo Kazooie, but Tim shot them down in an Interview with IGN stating [Double Fine makes their own games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnaXoaWOzk4). [They have been working a on project with a **new IP** since 2018](https://twitter.com/DoubleFine/status/959570067020070912?s=20).
5. **The Initiative**: They are currently working on the Reboot of **Perfect Dark**. Jeff Grubb has stated he believes this is set to release [in 2023](https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/13/xbox-bethesda-e3-2021-where-were-games-like-avowed-perfect-dark-and-fable/). Embracer Group studio [Crystal Dynamics](https://www.windowscentral.com/initiative-partners-crystal-dynamics-perfect-dark) is also helping with development of the title.
6. **inXile Entertainment**: This studio is working on **2 projects**, one in full development. One is in pre-production, and one is in full production. Both are very far out, likely 2024. The game in full production is code-named **Project Cobalt** [and is said to be a 1st Person Steampunk RPG by Jez Corden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcwZRfgAHpg). 
7. **Mojang Studios**: Currently working on the **The Wild** update for **Minecraft** releasing on June 7th and extended support for **Minecraft: Dungeons**. [In 2020 Mojang had rebranded in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YosWmbHAr2g) and stated that they want to develop new games and experiences in addition to Minecraft across their multiple global offices. They are also working on **Minecraft RT**, the Ray Traced Minecraft. [According to Jez Corden](https://www.windowscentral.com/mojang-keeps-posting-minecraft-pixel-style-concept-game-art-and-i-want-them-be-real), **2 brand new spin off titles** are coming from Mojang though what exactly they are he did not say.
8. **Ninja Theory**: Currently working on **Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2** (believed to be launching in 2023) and the smaller scale Project: Mara. [**Project: Mara**](https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/22/21077221/ninja-theory-project-mara-teaser) ""will be a real-world and grounded representation of true mental terror"" and ""will be based heavily on research, interviews, and firsthand accounts to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and believably as possible."" In addition, Ninja Theory announced the establishment of a research and development effort dealing with mental health, dubbed **The Insight Project**. [The Insight Project builds upon and continues the co-operation between Ninja Theory and Paul Fletcher, a University of Cambridge psychiatrist and professor of health neuroscience who had consulted the studio on Hellblade. With The Insight Project, Ninja Theory plans to build smaller games to ""help people identify and control negative emotions""](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-29-ninja-theory-launches-mental-health-r-and-d-effort).
9. **Obsidian Entertainment**: Confirmed in development projects are **Grounded** (an early access ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" survival game), **Avowed** (a 1st person RPG set in the Pillars of Eternity world of Eora), and Outer Worlds 2. Avowed is believed to be releasing in 2023 and the full release of Grounded in 2022. Additionally, Josh Sawyer is leading a project codenamed **Project Missouri** which has been reported to be titled **Pentiment** [by Jez Corden](https://www.windowscentral.com/new-upcoming-xbox-exclusives-project-midnight-compulsion-and-pentiment-obsidian). It is said to be a no combat RPG like Disco Elysium and ""you act as an investigator in 16th century Europe uncovering the truth behind a grisly murder."" Rumor of a **Critical Role RPG** (though the post for this has since been deleted along with its poster), [According to Jez](https://youtu.be/7yNcT7Gn4ag?t=6525), Obsidian is ""targeting 7 games in 7 years"".
10. **Playground Games**: Currently developing DLC and ongoing content for **Forza Horizon 5** at their main office and the reboot of **Fable** at their new office.  Fable is also believed to be launching in 2023 according to Jeff but this is informstion from 2021 and it could be later.
11. **Rare**: Currently developing new content for **Sea of Thieves**, having just released the cross over the Disney's Pirates IP, A Pirate's Life. They are also developing a new IP called **Everwild** though not much is known about it other than some cinematic shots. It is believed to be releasing in 2024 after being rebooted [according to Andy Robinson](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/why-wasnt-everwild-at-e3-its-been-completely-rebooted/). [According to Jeff Grubb](https://www.thegamer.com/rare-everwild-development/), the development even post reboot is still a mess.

14. **World's Edge**: While World's Edge does not develop games internally, they manage external partners who are developing content for the Age Of series. They are currently directing the development for content in **Age of Empires 2 DE, Age of Empires 3 DE, and Age of Empires 4**.

A new Age of Mythology game has been teased by [Jeff Grubb and Jez Corden](http://reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/tog40e/jez_corden_and_jeff_grubb_could_be_teasing_the/).

Other rumors point to a PvEvP game with a [potential Marvel IP](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/r7z1le/roundhouse_studio_is_working_on_a_pvpve_3rd/) in Unreal Engine 4 (likly moved to 5 due to the ease of uprading to UE5). No time frame for a release.
7. **Tango Gameworks**: Currently working on Development of **Ghostwire: Tokyo** set to release in early 2023 on Xbox consoles already released on PS5/PC.  At least 2 other games are in development at [Tango](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEWpAl1KDqo&feature=emb_logo)
8. **Zenimax Online Studios**: Currently continuing support of **Elder Scrolls Online**. Based on job listings, they seemingly have at least **two unannounced projects** in development. They seemingly opened a new studio in [Wisconsin](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/m6y4zv/zenimax_online_opened_another_studio_in_wisconsin/) as well (in addition to their Maryland and Austin locations).  One title has been rumored to be a **Mandalorian MMO** for [some time](https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/n35rs3/the_mandalorian_game_could_be_made_by_zenimax/).

**Activision**

Currently Activision has all of its studios working primarily on Call of Duty Projects according to [reports](https://twitter.com/AndyPlaytonic/status/1388068520886472707?s=20&t=ypYuTtqgB4TflnkWz9OD6Q).  As such this section is going to break down the multiple confirmed and rumored Call of Duty projects.  There are currently 0 confirmed or rumored non-Call of Duty Projects though Phil Spencer has discussed wanting to bring back a few [post acquisition finalization](https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/gaming/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-on-reviving-old-activision-games-as-microsoft-positions-itself-as-tech-e2-80-99s-gaming-company/ar-AASYQoM?ocid=uxbndlbing). It should be noted that any studio not directly associated with a title is likely supporting other studios.

The acquisition of Activision Blizzard King is expected to be finalized sometime during [Microsoft's Fiscal Year 2023](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/read-the-email-microsoft-gamings-ceo-sent-staff-about-its-dollar68-billion-purchase-of-activision/ar-AASUrKZ) (FY23), between July 2022 and June 2023.

Whether Call of Duty will be exclusive to platforms with Xbox Game Pass post 2023 is currently unknown.  [Phil Spencer](https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1484273335139651585?s=20&t=AcKWS1L4J9v9tWLLhDb0Vw) has made a singular comment on the subject: ""Had good calls this week with leaders at Sony. I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.""  It has been interpreted many ways leading to an inconclusive agreement across gaming circles and analysts.


According to a report from Bloomberg ([IGN linked](https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-no-longer-annualized-report) because of to Paywall), the Microsoft Acquisition is making them reconsider the annual release of their Call of Duty titles.

I think it a brilliant move, particularly how it‚Äôs played out.  The optics of Heard in court getting eviserated, while Depp is living his life and moving forward, it‚Äôs was a great visual.  She was alone in court, he said you won‚Äôt see me again, my life isn‚Äôt here and it won‚Äôt be determined by you.  I think it just feeds Johnny‚Äôs persona, it‚Äôs kind of badass and alternative, I‚Äôm sure he was advised to stay but he wanted to jam and hang with friends instead.  Add in the visual of Kate Moss showing up one night and them hanging afterwards, it was just perfect really.  Depp left Amber behind to face the music, while he played it. Fini.

Luckily, he was dumb enough to have pictures of his weapons developed at a drug store, and the photo clerk called police who in turn arrested the suspect. 

I remember trying to go to class one morning and the entire campus was locked down by the police as they searched for bombs that may have already been planted. It was a very confusing day, and as more information came out it became clear that I would have been on campus at the student center at the right time and may have gotten hurt or killed had this asshole's plan not been discovered. 

So, wherever you are Kelly, thank you for catching the photos and alerting the police.

Chase Coleman‚Äôs Tiger Global Management suffered huge losses in May amid a tech-driven sell-off, making the hedge fund‚Äôs tough 2022 even worse. The growth-focused flagship fund at Tiger Global tumbled 14.3% in May, bringing its 2022 losses to over 50%, a source familiar with the return told CNBC‚Äôs David Faber. In the first quarter, Tiger Global doubled down on a number of tech holdings, including Snowflake, Carvana and Sea, before the market decline got uglier, according to a regulatory filing. Carvana has plummeted 77% in the second quarter so far, while Snowflake is down 44% and Sea is off by more than 30% this quarter.

The tech sector, especially unprofitable firms and richly valued software names, has taken a beating lately in the face of rising rates. Those sharp declines in tech have pushed the Nasdaq Composite down more than 23% year to date and off 26% from its all-time high. Coleman is one of the so-called Tiger Cubs, protegees of legendary hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson. He had managed to produce double-digit annualized returns through 2020 by taking advantage of the explosive growth in technology. This year‚Äôs brutal sell-off has inflicted huge pain on some hedge funds. Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund burned by the GameStop mania, said last month it will unwind its funds and return cash to investors as losses accelerated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v39nwr/tiger_global_drops_14_in_may_during_the_tech/

******

If this isn't allowed, feel free to remove. I have seen several posts online about the current issue in Boston of drinks being spiked at various bars in the area. I just want to share my experience to inform others. 

I went to the Boston Sail Loft Cafe and Bar last night around 7pm alone. I ordered one cocktail, and the bar was not very busy. I saw the bartender make it in my peripheral. I couldn't keep eyes directly on it while she made it the entire time just due to the layout of the bar and other patrons. There was one bartender and one bar back on staff from what I could tell. I felt fine after the first drink and the bartender asked if I wanted a second drink. I also saw her prepare it in my peripheral.

Within a few sips of my second drink, I was beyond intoxicated. I can always have a couple of drinks and be fine to walk around, sight see, shop, etc. I was so intoxicated that it was hard to stand up straight. I was unable to walk to the bathroom without grabbing the wall. I sent messages to friends that I don't remember sending, I felt like I couldn't see straight and passed out pretty quickly when I got home. I'm honestly shocked I made it home. This was all before 8:30PM. I ate plenty yesterday, drank plenty of water, and was just on my way home from an appointment.

I woke up this morning feeling horrible - as if I easily had several strong drinks last night. I am shaky and still a little dizzy feeling. I feel so off and uncomfortable. I almost still feel drunk even though I had <1.5 drinks over 14 hours ago. I can't say for sure but I'm pretty convinced that something shady went on last night. I am a 5'4 F who lives alone so I am terrified about what potentially could've happened to me. 

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I want to share in case anyone else has experienced this or if anyone has any insight to share on this situation. Please stay safe out there my Boston friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/v3b4yp/i_believe_my_drink_may_have_been_spiked_near_the/

When I first started dating my boyfriend, he voluntary shared about his sexual history of unprotected causal sex. It made me believe that our values were not compatible and we were not suitable for one another.

He pursued and convinced me his past does not define who he is today. And before we officially got into a relationship, I requested that he undergo a STD test. He done so and showed me his test report which came back clean.

We have been together almost 2 years, and he has respected my wish to only have sex after marriage. We are now thinking of getting married. However, 
I‚Äôm wondering if I should ask him to do another STD test again? 

The reason for the thought is because we had our ups and downs in the past 2 years of relationship. There were times we fought badly and not speak for weeks. Part of me fear if there could have been instances of him cheating / going back to his old ways during our cold wars. 

Will like some advice from Reddit please. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v3dnz2/should_i_28f_ask_my_boyfriend_30m_to_do_a_std/

I found my biological father whilst I was in foster care. He‚Äôs from the Caribbean, I grew up in Hawaii. My mom is American. She‚Äôs a whole other can of beans. 

I would talk to him over WhatsApp and he‚Äôd talk to me. He didn‚Äôt raise me, so this is like, an issue of entitlement over my dating habits. 

He also expressed other things about how I should live my life, like eating pork is evil, and disliked the fact that I‚Äôm surrounded by evil Asians and Whites all of the time. You know, normal dad things. 

That is like, being an American GI and finding your long lost baby in the Philippines and discovering that, oh my god they don‚Äôt worship George Washington and they eat Dinguan and being mad about it. 

I was 17 when he found me, and he expected me to be completely in line with his culture and expectations. 

At the time, he‚Äôd send me money, which I appreciated because my foster parents would take all of the money they received from the government and only treated the Filipino foster child with any sense of care or love. If it‚Äôs not obvious, foster parents were Filipino. 

Me, and the other non-Filipino foster children were left to fend for ourselves. 

We had a roof over our heads and some food but that was the extent of them caring for us. We would have to buy our supplies for school, pay for laundry, find a way to get clothes, toiletries, etc. They were also openly racist. Foster parents eventually lost their license. Anyhow. 

While talking to my father, it was revealed he was a raging narcissist just like my mother. He‚Äôd tell grandiose tales about himself, how everyone loves him, and how I needed to go back to the Caribbean asap to go back to my ‚Äúculture‚Äù, and say how I was a black Caribbean girl. 

He would go on and on about culture, how I need to go back to my culture, how I am a pure black woman and I need to go back to my culture. 

Whenever I said I was mixed he said it was American cultural confusion. He was pretty racist against practically everyone who was not specifically exactly like him. 

Meanwhile, he wants to choose my husband, who of course, has to be ‚Äúpure‚Äù black, dark skinned, with dreadlocks like him. 

The audacity to think that he has the right to select a husband for his estranged daughter who grew up in the comparatively socially progressive Hawaii, SMH. 

At the time, I started dating this white guy who I thought was cute and we hit it off. Turns out we share a lot in common. 

Fast forward, my father kind of finds out because I casually mention my friend. I feel like I‚Äôm lying by withholding information so I come clean. 

My father, threatened to fly to Hawaii and kill my boyfriend‚Ä¶.and called me a nasty, Americanized bedw*nch, a sellout, that no one trusts black children with white fathers, that race mixing is American degeneracy, along with feminism and homosexuality. 

He disowned me and stopped talking to me. Not without a bunch of threats, calling me a dumb white girl, an American with no culture and a sellout. 

My dad is great yes. I‚Äôm just so dumbfounded by this man. He has me, with a white American woman, and gets mad that, when I‚Äôm raised by her, I don‚Äôt share his cultural ideals and I see myself as mixed? What?

Edit: Years have past since then. Me and that guy I talk about are engaged and we live together, in a pretty alright neighborhood with a pool and a dog. We‚Äôre living pretty ok. I have no contact with my father.",https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/v33mcy/my_black_father_called_me_a_mixed_race_woman_a/

#Wind energy

The U.S. is finally starting to ramp up investment in wind power with projects planned for the East Coast,  West Coast, and the western interior.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management [announced](https://www.wfae.org/energy-environment/2022-05-11/2-companies-win-auction-for-north-carolina-offshore-wind-leases) last month that two companies won an auction to build wind farms off the coasts of the Carolinas. Duke Energy Renewables Wind bid $155 million for one lease, and French energy developer TotalEnergies Renewables won the other with a $160 million bid.
Together, they will result in at least 1.3 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes.  

>As part of their winning bids, the companies agreed to contribute a total of $42 million to workforce training and to help develop a U.S. supply chain for the offshore wind industry‚Ä¶‚ÄúThe new bidding credit in the Carolina Long Bay auction will result in tangible investments for workforce training and businesses in the United States, to ultimately create jobs in the U.S. across the industries needed to support achieving our offshore wind goals,‚Äù said BOEM Director Amanda Lefton.

The lessees are also [required](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/carolina-long-bay-wind-energy-auction-/) to use telemetry tracking stations on meteorological buoys to gather information on the offshore movements of birds and bats in the hopes of mitigating any environmental impacts.

The Department of the Interior also [announced](https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/california) two offshore wind energy auctions off the California coast. The proposed leases would open up areas in the Pacific near Eureka and another parcel near Morro Bay (between Los Angeles and San Francisco), with the potential to power more than 1.5 million homes.

###Onshore wind

The Bureau of Land Management [issued](https://wyofile.com/greenlit-powerlines-portend-wyoming-wind-energy-boom/) the final approval last week for construction of major transmission lines connecting Wyoming to California, Nevada, and Arizona. The $3 billion, 732-mile long TransWest Express transmission line will transport electricity generated by wind energy in south-central Wyoming, where 900 wind turbines can produce 3,000 megawatts.

>The added transmission capacity and increased number of ‚Äúon-ramps‚Äù and ‚Äúoff-ramps‚Äù that the transmission lines would provide to Wyoming and the western grid set the stage for a major buildout of wind turbines in the state. When completed, that extra capacity and interconnectivity would also provide PacifiCorp ‚Äî and possibly others ‚Äî the ability to retire coal-fired power units in the state by meeting several new state-level power delivery and reliability requirements, according to University of Wyoming energy economist Rob Godby.

#Pebble mine

The Environmental Protection Agency last week [proposed](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/25/epa-proposes-to-veto-pebble-mine-to-protect-salmon-rich-bristol-bay/) protections for a watershed in Alaska that is the location of a future open pit mine. The [Bristol Bay](https://www.epa.gov/bristolbay/about-bristol-bay) watershed in southwest Alaska is home to the world's largest sockeye salmon run, where  more than 73 million sockeye are expected in a record return to spawn this summer.

>The mine would result in the loss of almost 100 miles of stream habitat, 8.5 miles of salmon habitat, and 2,113 acres of wetlands and waters at the mine site, the EPA notes, drawing from the mine plan.

The mine developer, Pebble Limited Partnership, called the Bristol Bay deposit ‚Äúone of the greatest stores of mineral wealth ever discovered,‚Äù including gold, copper, silver and molybdenum.

>Pebble, for its part, [called](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2022/05/31/as-epa-moves-to-block-pebble-mine-supporters-and-opponents-look-to-details/) the EPA‚Äôs proposal a step backward not just for the mine, but for President Biden‚Äôs climate goals. Minerals like copper are used to make batteries and in other renewable energy technologies. Pebble said the administration shouldn‚Äôt hinder domestic production.

#Social cost of carbon

The Supreme Court [rejected](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/SCOTUS-upholds-Biden-s-use-of-social-cost-of-17201599.php) red states‚Äô attempt last week to block the Biden administration from using its own estimate of the social impacts of climate change.

The [‚Äòsocial cost of carbon‚Äô](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/04/01/social-cost-of-carbon/)  is an estimate of the economic damages of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide. Policymakers use the social cost of carbon to quantify the extra costs associated with carbon emissions that are not automatically reflected in market prices. The Obama administration had estimated the social cost of carbon at $43 a ton. Trump then lowered it to $3-$5 a ton, and Biden raised it to $51 a ton.

Republican states sued the Biden administration, arguing that Biden lacked the authority to raise the climate metric under the Constitution, which gives that power solely to Congress. Trump-appointee James Cain, of the Western District of Louisiana, agreed with the GOP and [issued](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/11/politics/social-cost-of-carbon-federal-judge-biden-climate/index.html) an injunction preventing the Biden administration from even considering the social cost of carbon. Two months ago, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals [overturned](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/16/appeals-court-social-cost-carbon-biden-trump-00017986) Cain‚Äôs ruling.

While the Supreme Court denied the Republican states‚Äô request to issue an injunction, it did not rule on the legality of the ‚Äòsocial cost of carbon‚Äô itself. The administration can use the $51 a ton metric as the case continues its way through the court system.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/v39cyb/good_news_for_once_government_invests_in_wind/

What could possibly be more dangerous than a GME subreddit full of pissed off, DRS'd GME investors who've already bought and registered $1.5 BILLION worth of shares?:

# MILLIONS OF NEWCOMER WOULD-BE GME INVESTORS WITH UNTAPPED CASH AND INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS, WHO WOULD INEVITABLY FOLLOW THE SAME PATH WE ALL HAVE.

When they say ""Meme Stock"", *that's* their intended audience.

Calling GME a meme stock isn‚Äôt directed at us- it‚Äôs directed at the millions of normie investors out there that Wall Street NEEDS to stay asleep.

They CANNOT afford to have the rate of GME investor newcomers grow, so they call it a meme stock to subtly encourage uninformed and/or ignorant outsiders to scoff.

# Why?

Bc *underneath the surface*, when humans scoff at things they privately know they haven‚Äôt personally studied, there‚Äôs *actually* a mix of:

* fear of loss
* fear of confirming/confronting one‚Äôs own ignorance
* fear of being exposed to others as uninformed and/or ignorant
* fear of being associated w/ the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù crowd (""Do you seriously listen to all those idiot GME reddit traders?""
* ego stroking
* perceived self-preservation
* etc

‚Ä¶and all of that keeps *most* would-be newcomers away from even considering learning more about GME.

&#x200B;

# So what? Why does knowing this change anything?

Because the very thing they tipped their hand about is something WE have the POWER, RIGHT NOW, to CHANGE.

It's on US to educate- DON'T GET OFFENDED. THEY'RE FUCKING TERRIFIED OF YOU OPENING MORE AND MORE INVESTOR MINDS THAN THEY CAN AFFORD TO FIGHT.

# LET'S GO FUCKING GET THEM!
