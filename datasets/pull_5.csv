No it’s not a bait. And I’m still suffering the consequences.

Friday evening my partner and I engaged in some fun activities, while he decided to do me from behind I started feeling ill, then turning me around missionary I started feeling dizzy. He noticed and stopped and asked if I was okay, of course I said, must be my low blood pressure, I thought giving it a minute it would get better.

Spoiler alert: it got much much worse.

I started experiencing the worst vertigo of my life, I couldn’t move my head an inch, I just had to lie down on my back and try to breath. The entire room was spinning even though I wasn’t moving, even though I closed my eyes. I started feeling sick, and eventually ended up vomiting the rest of the night, while the room was still spinning, which made me vomit, it was an endless bad cycle. 

At last, I fell asleep, thinking it would go away in the morning like a fool.
Ended up having to stay 7 hours in the emergency room, with what they called “benign paroxysmal positional vertigo”. 
If you’ve never heard of it you’re not the only one, basically, you have tiny microscopic crystal like stones in our inner ear, otoliths, the disease is literally called “crystal illness” in my native language, and those stones can get loose, which messes up your balance.
It can take weeks before you fully recover and I still can’t turn my head or look down without nausea and vertigo.

TLDR: My boyfriend fucked me so hard microscopic crystals in my ear fell out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v1kzr1/tifu_by_having_sex_doggystyle/

His biggest clients are small to medium sized businesses. 

Well he had a client who owned 4 different clubs/bars in 2 different cities. Client was always shady, always slow on payment, etc. I was also a customer of one of the bars, they had poker game that I would play in on Thursdays. 

Well one day I'm at my buddy house, having a few beers and he's bitching about non payment from a client. I ask who, he doesn't wanna say. But its really bugging him because its a significant chunk of change. He then says the name, we'll call him Scott. 

I'm like ""Wow Scott isn't paying you?"" he then says Scott is saying business is way down and I think that's odd I've been going to one Scott place and every Thursday is packed. My buddy looks at me and goes ""really?"" I go ""Yea he does this new cash discount think, 15% off your tab if you pay cash"" my buddy goes ""Really?""

I tell him about my experience at Scott bar, and eventually the topic changes. A few weeks later my buddy calls me up and says ""you going to Scotts bar to play poker?"" I said ""Yea"" he says ""can I join?"" I go ""Sure""

He joins, we get a few drinks in us, lose our money at poker, my house is closer he decides to crash there. On the way over he breaks down his theory

He thinks Scott is vastly under reporting his revenue, the reason why he suspects Scott is offering cash discount is cause cash is easier to hide. He says he's going do a deep dive on Scotts finances.

My friend tells me his plan is to go all 4 of Scotts establishments, get the prices he charges at each place, pieces together how much alcohol he's buying, vs how much Scott is saying his revenue equates too. He looks up how much Scott is paying in payroll, rent, bills, etc. Keep in mind he has access to all this info.

And he determines that Scott is basically using his credit card receipts + a little bit of cash to cover his cost of his business to include rent, payroll, insurance, liquor, food, etc....however based upon the amount of products he's selling he's suspecting Scott is under reporting his total income by about 35%-40%. 

He goes back into Scotts books even more, and he figures in the last year Scott has been under reporting his sales by 35%-40% but he's also been under reporting his sales by at least 20%-25% for years on end. Simply put there is no way Scott is going through as much product, and as much alcohol as he's purchasing and having the revenue numbers that's he's claiming, he's under reporting his sales to his accountant...

Which means he's also under reporting his earnings to the IRS. By this point Scott owes my friend thousands of dollars that he hasn't paid. He said his total amount owe could buy a brand new motorcycle. He never gave me an exact number.

My friend decides fuck getting repayment from Scott, lets get repayment from the IRS through the whistleblower program. He's estimating Scotts under reported his revenue by millions of dollars over the course of years. The whistle blower fees he'd earn form the IRS far out weighs the amount Scott owes him. The IRS will pay between 15-30% of what they collect.

So with the assistance of a lawyer my friend gathers all the evidence he has has Scotts under reporting to the IRS and files a whistle blower report with the IRS. During this time my friend fires Scott as a client for non payment. Now this part gets boring cause there's a lot of legal wrangling and back and forth, this went back and forth. 

However eventually the IRS comes down on Scott, and they come down hard. Its estimated that Scott under reported his income to the IRS by about $4.5 million dollars. Now my friend never told me how much the IRS was able to recoup, but Scotts businesses are no longer his businesses, and $4.5 million dollars would put the whistle blower reward at $675k-$1.3 million. Keep in mind its based on what the IRS collects, not the amount that's reported.

I've asked my friend how much he got in the end, and he's simply says ""I no longer have a mortgage, and it would have been much cheaper for Scott to just pay me""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/v1lg78/you_should_always_pay_your_accountant_especially/

So, I’m a black man living in Eastern Europe. Cue one fateful afternoon when I wanted to go down and collect something from a friend who was passing by. I press the elevator and wait for it to arrive. Elevator door opens and there’s a couple inside, but as I try to enter, the man blocks the passage, telling me to wait for the elevator to return. 

Mind you, I’m on the 7th floor, and my friend was already waiting for me to come down. Also, the elevator has a fixed time before its doors close (about 20 seconds). So you’ll have to wait for the doors to close after you enter. 

Back to my story. I tell this man and his wife that I’m actually in a hurry and had to go down now. And he literally stands in front of the elevator entrance, shouting “No!”  His wife tells him to let me in since there was still space, but he refused. I said alright and decided to use the stairs. 

Cue my petty revenge. I ran down the stairs (didn’t mind the cardio really) and pressed all the elevator buttons on all the lower floors. Got to my friend and collected my package, then ran back upstairs. On my way back up, I could hear the man cussing out inside the elevator and his wife’s laughter. They hadn’t even reached the ground floor yet. 

I felt so proud of myself. Haha!!!

TLDR: man refuses to let me enter the elevator when I was in a hurry, and I ran down and pressed all the elevator buttons",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/v1kbbe/man_refuses_to_let_me_enter_the_elevator_ends_up/

TW: mention of child abuse 

—

[ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/jjp1li/mama_karen_wanted_me_to_turn_off_my_tv_when_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I just moved in to an apartment last week. So far, everyone I have met in passing has been nice. No one has been too loud at unreasonable hours, arguing with each other, stealing parking spaces, and other typical shared space craziness. Yet, at least. Only been here a week.   

I did, however, encounter a Mama Karen and her 6(?) yr old son.   

My apartment is one of those half in the ground units with two other floors on top. As such, the top of my patio wall is level to the walking path. If I have my blinds open, you can easily see into my living room and kitchen. This honestly doesn't bother me. The weather is finally really nice here, so after work yesterday I opened my patio sliding door and blinds to let the cooler air in while playing some Minecraft. After a while, I could hear a couple of women talking outside a few units down. Just general chit-chat. I also heard a smaller kid running around, messing with the gravel along the pathways and generally just being a bored kid while mommy talked with her friend. Really no big deal at all. Then it happened. I heard one of the women called for the kid. ""Jason. Jason? JASON. Get over here. J A S O N!! (fake name for protection)"" I looked up to see the kid standing on the path next to my unit transfixed on the tv. Uh-oh. He didn't answer quick enough... Mama Karen came stomping over to him and jerked his arm to force him to look at her while she yelled in his face about answering her and to not watch tv, especially someone else's. I thought the way she was acting was overkill, but let it be. He's not my kid and I'm not a parent at all (just to my furbabies, 2 cats). I did pay attention for if things got worse to jump in, but didn't stare. I only looked over when she called out to me to apologize for her son (note: not for her behavior). I said it was fine.   

Mama Karen took him back over to her friend and they continued talking.  Eventually, the kid started playing around near them again. Soon, he was back over at my patio looking in watching me play. Soon after that, I hear Mama Karen yell at him again. This time he flinched (hard, it broke my heart to see the effects of abuse in action) and was just frozen staring at her. This time I jumped up and went to my patio door. She was already at him by them and yelling at him again. I tried to interject to say I truly didn't mind that he was watching me play. This is where the Karen aspect comes in. She turned to me sickly sweet, the demon gone for the moment, and kindly explained that dear Jason was grounded and not allowed to even look at a tv. I said a ""bummer, dude"" to him in sympathy. She didn't like that I addressed him and not her. I also don;t think she liked that I showed him sympathy instead of instantly taking her side, even though I had no idea why he was punished in the first place (I wouldn't doubt if it was some asinine, non-existent reason on her part, or her being bothered by normal child behaviors). She then asked me something that blew my mind.   

""Can you please shut off your tv when we're out here? We are usually out here for some outside time for about an hour a day. Or you can just shut your window and blinds.""  

Ngl, the People Pleaser I have been raised to be almost said ""Oh, sure, no problem!"" and was going to do it. Then I stopped myself thinking ""Uh... What? Telling me what to do in MY house?"". I'm trying to have a shinier spine. I told her no, I won't. Oh boy! That sure as hell is her trigger word! I thought she was going to reach in and jerk me around and yell at me like I was her child! The look was so instantly pissed off. She again explained the situation fully expecting me to cooperate this time. She laid out her case. She made the demand again; not a faux question this time. I again told her no. I came home to relax and this is how I do it. She asked me if I have kids. Uh-oh. I'm solidly child-free, and according to the Laws of Parenting, my thoughts and opinions are completely and instantly invalid unless I pop out at least one(1) entire mostly full term crotch spawn. I told her no and she smirked. ""I thought so."" I was ready for a lecture on how to handle kids ""properly"" or something, but she just jerked her son away back towards the other woman, who I assumed was still there. She said something as she went, but I didn't really hear it, so I don't know if it was to me, her son, or her friend. Maybe even grumbling to herself.   

I hadn't seen those two before yesterday, but apparently they are out there for at least one hour daily around that time. There's a pool, a few BBQ pits, and a grassy area outside my unit in between the surrounding units/buildings. I get to see all the good doggos walk by and it makes my day! I really hope she doesn't cause issues for me. I just want to live there and not be bothered. I'm not going to help her parent her child. No one else in the whole world should be expected to except her. I just don;t get how she thinks she can ask a total stranger to turn off the tv in THEIR HOME because she's punishing her child in her's. Like...no. It doesn't work that way. I'm proud of myself for standing my ground, as brief as the encounter was. I worry for the kid though...

Thank you to everyone who has replied, upvoted, and given awards! I was just dropping a rant and didn't expect this to get this big! 

I have been reading *everything*. I just couldn't keep up responding to it all. Now I completely get ""RIP inbox"", lol. 

So, a small development. I called CPS. I thought about it a LOT since posting yesterday. I even consulted a few people I know who have been on both sides (reporting and being reported). After telling them the story and hearing their experiences and advice, I decided to go ahead and do it. What really did it for me was that while the kid may have done something to earn the grounding and maybe the mom had a really bad millennia that exploded in that moment, her physically jerking him around, yelling in his face, and especially his reactions pushed me to do it for his benefit. 

I did it anonymously and don't know which exact unit she's in. I was kind of surprised that I talked to an actual person. At first, she kind of had the tone of just taking a general complaint. As soon as I explained the kid's reactions, especially being completely non-verbal when being yelled at and shook, she took more intetest. I was warned that this call didn't guarantee an investigation. Also that it could take time to start and even more time to conclude depending on various factors (me not knowing the exact unit number being one of them). 

So far, I haven't seen Mama Karen or the kid today to play spy on that part and I'm afraid to ask around in case someone gives her a head's up. If she happens to bother me more, I'll tell the front office. For now, because I just moved in, I don't want to make it seem like I'm going to be that strict, nosey neighbor that reports every little thing, even if a legitimate worry in this case. I will get an outdoor cam in a paycheck or two. I just moved, I'm a broke bitch, lol. 

Hopefully, I won't have to update again at all, or that it will be some time and with good news.

First off, I want to say a huge thank you to all the advice and awards! I never expected this to get this big!

Second, just to get it out of the way, the kid has been removed to his bio dad's house and is doing well! He is wanted there and loved from what I have been told. 

Okay, so last night I heard some people talking just outside my patio on the walkway. Like, a small crowd of people and they hung around talking for a bit. Just past my patio a couple walkways meet. It drew my attention to see what was going on. I had my blinds shut at the time, but the patio door cracked for the cooler air. I sat at that end of the couch and listened a bit. Almost right away I got that they were talking about that Mama Karen and her kid. I waffled a moment, but went out on my patio to listen better and speak up. I asked about the situation and said I had been worried for the boy. Turns out, this is Karen's third child and the other two had also been removed! They let me know this kid was now with his bio dad while the other two had been put in the child care system because their father's either didn't want them or couldn't take them. The crowd was there because they wanted to gossip about the cops and CPS showing up the evening before to get the kid. One of them was her neighbor and said that she didn't beg for her kid not to be taken so much as begged for herself to not be arrested, but was also yelling and screaming at the cops. By the end of it, the kid is out from under her and she was not arrested, but given some sort of ticket or summons(?) concerning the kid's treatment. I told them my experience with her and they agreed it was right to call CPS. After hearing their stories of encounters with her and all three kids and calls to CPS over the last 8 or so years she's lived there, I knew I made the right choice in this case. After being reassured the kid was safe with his bio dad and his wife, I thanked them for the info and went back inside. They talked for about an hour more outside about random catch up stuff between them.

So, that's it. Kid has been rescued! I am so relived for him! 

I'd like to address one type of comment I saw pop up several times. Some were ragging on me for calling his flinching a sign of abuse. All I can say is that it was a ""you had to see it yourself"" moment. I can describe it to death and it won't have the same impact. Those who have been abused or have seen the results know the exact kind of flinch I am talking about. It's not just a ""I got caught!"" kind of startled. It's more like recoiling from an impending physical blow they know usually follows that kind of words/tone/volume, or like the words themselves are the hit. 

Yes, I completely understand that calling CPS, or any authority, can have lasting effects that might look bad on innocent people and create stigma in their community. My friends who have had CPS called on them were at first very upset and angry. Then later they realized it meant someone was looking out for their kid(s). Even if it had been someone trying to stir shit and create a stigma against them or misunderstood a situation (ie; seeing a moment of blow up), if they were good parents then it will quickly be realized. CPS can also provide various resources for struggling parents from counseling to assistance programs. It's not solely about taking kids away. The friends who had CPS called on them were able to realize they were struggling in some ways and got whatever help they needed that way. We only see moments and slices of people's lives at a time. Sometimes it can look horrible. I agree it is important to look for other signs that it is truly a bad situation. I just can't completely turn a blind eye. I'd rather make sure someone is okay.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/v1o80b/entitled_mom_asks_oop_to_turn_off_their_tv_when/

The coin has seen an insane increase over the past couple months.

TRON has recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin [USDD](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usdd/). The algorithm governing the stablecoin’s dollar-peg is an arbitrage trade between USDD and TRX, Tron's network’s native token. *Hmm... this reminds me of something but I can't put my finger on it....*

Now here's this week's best offer! [You can earn up to 57% through sun.io's LP!](https://imgur.com/a/JoFQgSH) What a great deal.

According to [Defillama](https://defillama.com/peggedassets/stablecoins) USDD is #10 stablecoin by market cap, with a 20% increase over the past week, this figure is up from $90 million recorded during its day of launch on **May 5, 2022**. *Hmm... I have a vouge memory of something that happened in early May 2022...*

Oh and we haven't even checked the **project's founder, Justin Sun.**

Let's get started:

Justin Sun launched TRON's whitepaper during the ICO craze in 2017, days before China's ban on ICO's. He raised $70 million and left the country. Sun had been **tipped off by Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance.** Does this also sound familiar....? 

On top of that. [it's been also reported that he copy pasted the project's whitepaper from another coin](https://coincentral.com/community-accuses-tron-plagiarizing-whitepaper/). This only adds to the pile of cards that his so called ""algorithmic stablecoin"" is a scam waiting to collapse.

It is no coincidence that Justin also left China, days after the ICO ban was announced.

On top of all that, it's been reported that:

* He hosted a ton of fake giveaways in 2019 announcing fake winners and retracting prizes.

* He announced fake partnerships with big organizations such as Liverpool F.C., who have denied connections.

* It's been reported that Justin has sold most of his TRON coins after the ICO and bought a large chunk of ETH. Some say he owns more ETH than the projects' Co-Founder Vitalik.

[You can read more here](https://www.theverge.com/c/22947663/justin-sun-tron-cryptocurrency-poloniex)

So, what do we make of all these? Justin Sun, the creator of TRX and USDD, not only literally copy pasted everything, he has also been involved in a huge amount of sketchy dealings and scams. 

My hope is that people like Justin and projects like LUNA and TRX are wiped off entirely from the market, for this is the only way to move forward and build something meaningful.

Edit: Hey, this kinda blew up, thanks for the awards! I want to elevate some good comments that folks have made: 

1.) Line drying is always your best bet if your climate / space allows. 

2.) Drying on Low / delicate, potentially in a lingerie bag is the next best thing to line drying. 

3.) Don’t blast your hoodies on high heat in the dryer in any case, it’s bad news. 

4.) Folks have mentioned that the zipper will go wavy anyway if you zip it or not, it just depends on the heat since the fabric is shrinking either way (and that I am full of hooey - cheeky ;) ) Honestly, that hasn’t been my experience, I will say it would probably be better not to dry them on anything above low heat, but when I have dried them on higher heat  (I don’t love some of my hoodies and I am often lazy and in a hurry) being zipped up produces far less zipper waviness than unzipped. I’m not sure if this is because the fabric is shrinking away from the zipper in a uniform manner when zipped or something, but just conveying my experience. Don’t nuke your beloved zip-up hoodie on nuclear blast setting while zipped up just to be safe - check out the tips above if you wanna preserve it for the aliens who will discover our civilization eons from now.  But if you’re lazy like me, medium-high zipped up seems to work reasonably well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/v1h363/lpt_zip_up_your_hoodies_before_you_put_them_in/

We arrived late at night. On the way back my sister was acting weird and both of us were concerned but she waived us off. This was unequivocally the biggest mistake of my life. She lost control of the handle and car swerved off the highway and crashed. Everything was a blur but I came to a week later in a hospital bed.  I was hospitalised for 4 months. I had broken my right arm in 3 different places, broke 6 ribs and my left lung was no longer operational. However, the worst pain I felt was finding out my brother had passed that night. 

My twin brother was my world. We would never be separated. We did every activity together. He was the one person I could pour my heart out to. We were identical in so many ways but also two completely different people. Throughout school we would be mistaken as one another. We could pass ourselves off as the other because we knew each other's mannerisms right to the dot. Heck we were good enough to fool our teachers and did each other's tests. We would make up for each others deficits and I felt whole as a result. 

I instantly fell into a depression. I wouldn't eat, sleep, walk or talk. I was in this sorry state for a year. I was like this for 2 years. My sister also confessed she was high that night. She was apparently stressed that night because her boyfriend had broken up with her. Ever since then I've hated her. She came out with few small injuries but my brother was the one who paid the price for her poor choices. Aside from losing my brother I can no longer part-take in any sports. I have a huge scar running alongside my chest as a constant reminder. The worst part is this injury will be the end of me. It'll take time but the doctors told me it's going to catch up to me sooner or later. 

I can't help but think about this and it makes my blood boil. I've tried to move on and I've done my best but I will never be able to forgive my sister. My parents have and it makes me sick. My wife thinks it's time to forgive her and really wants me to be the bigger person. Everyone I talk to tells me it was. mistake and I should forgive her. What do I do?

Starks always earns a reaction out of the crowd and makes for an entertaining time, waking up even the most exhausted audiences.

&#x200B;

Ever since I started watching AEW, Starks has been one of these guys who always becomes a highlight of the show. Along with others such as MJF, Eddie Kingston, Moxley, Jericho or Punk, **you don't hear silence whenever Starks is on your TV**, and that's the most important thing in pro wrestling: don't make it boring.

&#x200B;

We all know about Starks' physical issues such as his neck, and this is one of the reasons why I'd say to try and pull the trigger on him now rather than wait and see. Even without issues, I'd say it's time already for him to be in the actual title picture (Sorry, FTW championship, but it's clear it will not become much better than what it is right now).

&#x200B;

I must say, I was a bit disappointed Starks and Hobbs didn't win the tag titles, bc of the dynamic with Hookhausen. Still, I don't see why they couldn't continue this story with Jurassic Express or Starks going after the TNT title. World title doesn't seem posible yet, but he's due for a TNT title chance already... again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/v1pcqq/ricky_starks_is_aews_most_consistent_asset_and/

>**Q:** You played RNG today. Which player was the most impressive?

>**Faker:** **There were no players that stood out to me.** Our own performance was a bit disappointing, so I’m only focusing on that.

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/17331/msi-2022-t1-faker-todays-loss-was-positive-because-it-helped-me-see-what-i-lacked)

Let's compare this to what he has said about other players in the past:



>**Q:** What are Griffin’s strengths?

>**Faker:** They’re a team that has good basic fundamentals. They think a lot about team play, so **rather than one person, I’ll need to look out for all five players** with their movements as a team.

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/8958/lck-finals-media-day-skt-faker-many-people-told-me-that-my-postseason-performance-was-amazing-im-thankful-but-i-still-have-areas-to-improve-in)



>**Q:** You’ll meet Rookie, Doinb or Knight at the MSI. If you pick one to play against, who would you pick?

>**Faker:** **I’m confident in playing against any player.** Last year, the mid laners of the LPL got high evaluations, but I think LCK will be more competitive this year.

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/8015/press-interview-skt-faker-our-victory-couldve-been-so-much-more-satisfying-had-the-match-gone-to-a-game-5)

>**Q:** In a previous interview, you stated that you wanted to play against LPL teams. Which teams/players in particular did you have in mind?

>**Faker:**I wanna play against the top two LPL seeds, EDG and FPX, because I feel that they played really well in the Summer split. As for the player, **I don’t think I really have any particular player I’m excited to face**, because I want to focus on how I can improve, rather than others.

>**Q:**What’s your biggest source of motivation right now?

>**Faker:** Right now, it's performing at a level that I’m satisfied with. Putting on a great performance for the fans is what keeps me going. And… yeah that’s it, I think [laughter].

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/15098/t1-faker-ive-been-satisfied-with-my-accomplishments-and-results-but-never-fully-in-life-that-feeling-is-what-keeps-me-motivated)



>**Q:** Among those rookies you’re leading to Worlds, who do you have the highest expectations of? Who do you think will pop off the most? Who is the strongest under pressure?

>**Faker:** **I don’t think there’s a rookie player that’s more outstanding than the other**, because they’re all good. I think that I’ll just focus on improving my own form.

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/15098/t1-faker-ive-been-satisfied-with-my-accomplishments-and-results-but-never-fully-in-life-that-feeling-is-what-keeps-me-motivated)



The common denominator is Faker *always* focuses on his & his team's own performance, mistakes, and failures. Even in the very interview in question, he goes on to say:

>**Q:** You reached the finals of an international tournament, but unfortunately lost. How did today’s loss feel to you? 

>**Faker:** In a way, today’s loss was positive because **it helped me see what I lacked**. **I think I’ll be able to improve more in the future**, so I’m looking forward to the Summer Split and Worlds.


----------

Nobody batted an eye at *any* of the previous interviews. It is dishonest to blow this up as if Faker meant any disrespect to RNG's players. 

The reaction to Faker's interview from Chinese, Korean, and even some Western fans, is short-sighted:

**1) It is entitled of anybody to think themselves as deserving praise from Faker.**

If Faker praises anybody on RNG for this series, what does that make of anybody he hasn't praised in the past? Is Xiaohu officially better than Rookie or Knight? Now, people will *really* see it as a sign of disrespect when Faker does not praise his opponent after a loss. This is precisely why Faker never does this. 

I could end the post here. This is probably 90% of the reason Faker doesn't single out pro players. His words carry too much weight. For the sake of argument, let's explore other reasons anyway:

**2) Faker has high expectations of himself**

If you've seen Faker's past interviews, it's obvious he doesn't pay attention to what others are doing. If he feels that he has underperformed, how his opponents played is irrelevant. He is his own competition. 

**3) Performance is relative**

Everybody knows your own performance in a game is relative to your opponents' mistakes, and vice versa. If you make a mistake completely unrelated to your opponent (e.g. dying to a 2:45 Lee Sin gank that was seen on a ward), yes your opponent outperformed you, but they didn't do anything to make this happen. All Faker would be thinking is ""I just had to give up a few CS, the wave was pushing into me."" 

**4) His standards for other players are high**

All great players are compared to peak Faker. But what happens when you are Faker himself and there is no player in existence that surpasses your prime? Is it wrong for him to not be impressed by anybody in particular? 

----------------

For the inevitable:

>inb4 ""B-b-but Faker praised hotshotGG before!!!""

Faker doesn't conduct himself the way he did 9 years ago, obviously. Praise from Faker nowadays is rare. Two conditions usually have to be met for this to even have a chance of happening. 

1) Faker must be asked about that player in particular and

2) Faker must genuinely be impressed by that player in particular (**over anybody else in the category**). 

The most recent occurence of Faker praising a player of his own volition (one of very few times) was to the KT newcomer, VicLa:

>At the end of game 2, you stated that KT played very well tonight [referring to in-game comms in which Faker commented that the enemy played well]. What aspects of their gameplay were impressive?

>Their rookie mid laner, Lee “VicLa” Dae-kwang plays with a lot of confidence. I thought to myself that he’s a really good player. KT’s a team that continues to stay proactive even when they’re down. They’re very unpredictable at times, so we played very carefully.

[source](https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/16660/t1-faker-vicla-plays-with-a-lot-of-confidence-hes-a-really-good-player)

--------------

I'll also add, retconning Faker's performance this MSI because of his interview, or because of the game 5 loss is shameful. Faker had a phenomenal performance overall, minus 1 game, as well as getting MVP for both of T1's wins in the finals. He is arguably in the best form he's been in since 2018. This MSI showed that, and even if it wasn't enough to win it all, they got incredibly close. 

I'm rambling now, but this was Faker's first finals apperance at an international event in 5 years. This was really hype and it should have been a fun finals, but the negativity surrounding it blows. As a fan, I've realized that the expectation of Faker and T1 winning everything just fucking kills the mood at every international tournament they go to. They've been the underdogs for 5 years now. I'm guilty of this too but I think it's about time we separated SKT and T1 from one another and ease up a bit on the expectations (although the trash-talking T1's botlane have been doing doesn't help lol). 

Their Worlds 2021 run was magical for this exact reason. A brand new roster, 2 rookies who've played less than 30 games total, 3 players who've never set foot on an international stage, having just lost their head coach, going to Worlds with the expectation to fail, taking Damwon to 5 games. 0 pressure, 0 expectation, 0 negativity. Only hype. 

The burden of expectation is too great. There is a reason for the Worlds curse and the fact that no team / no player has ever won Worlds twice besides SKT.^(+duke)

--------------------

**I DISAVOW**: I don't know what the fuck Polt was on about, Polt not taking responsibility for T1's loss was disappointing to say the least. He seems to think side selection in League is like StarCraft map selection where one race has an insurmountable advantage on certain maps or something. Polt saying what he said probably had a lot to do with how Faker's statement was received.

-------------------

TL;DR: Faker didn't mean to disrespect RNG & I can't believe there are doubters in 2022.",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/v1mbdj/regarding_fakers_postmsi_interview_this_is_what/

What their often tiny brains fail to comprehend is that argument and evidence aren’t the same thing. An argument is a set of propositions from which another proposition is logically inferred. The evidence is what supports the premises of an argument (i.e. as in the so-called categorical syllogism), making the propositions true if supporting and false if lacking. 

Another way of looking at it is to see arguments as the reasons we have for believing something is true and evidence as supporting those arguments. Or evidence as the body of facts and arguments as the various explanations of that body of facts. 

Further, arguments alone aren’t evidence because they do not contain anything making them inherently factual, contrary to what most Christians believe; instead, to reiterate, arguments either have evidence in support of their premises or they don’t. This is what the majority of Christians have difficulty understanding. An argument can be valid, but if it’s not supported by the evidence, it won’t be sound i.e. 

*1. All men are immortal;* 

*2. Socrates is a man;* 

*3. Therefore Socrates is immortal* 

… is a valid, but unsound argument. These kinds of arguments can support a plethora of contradictory positions precisely because they aren’t sound. Without evidence, we cannot know whether an argument is sound or not. This is why arguments like the ontological, cosmological, teleological and all others like them used by Christians to “prove” god exists ≠ evidence. Therefore all of them prove nothing. 

It's also worthwhile to point out there isn’t a single sound argument for the existence of god. Any argument for the existence of god is bound to fail because there’s no evidence of its existence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/v1ojnh/christians_cannot_tell_the_difference_between/

If you are harassing others: know that it doesn’t read as anything other than hateful and desperate, and looks sad. Women and people in general are not property.",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/v1q20z/psa_summer_is_back_dont_yell_at_women/

Excuse my language. But I want to fucking scream.

It's 4:45 am. I got up at 4. Made his lunch and his breakfast, got his drinks packed. Put everything in his lunch box. Got his clothes. Then walked upstairs to wake him up.

Went downstairs and finished up everything. Started the vehicle. He came down. Asked for his other brand of jeans. I got them.

Asked me to pick him up and deliver him energy drinks at a specific time this morning. Told him I'd oblige.

I told him what time I set the reminder alarm for so I wouldn't forget. He says I should set it earlier because I took an ungodly long time in town yesterday at the grocery store he swears I was gone almost 2 hours, mind you I rushed out of the house because he said we were down to our last one eighth of a roll of toilet paper so I grabbed what little cash we had and ran to get what we need.

Then he said something about not understanding why it takes me so long in town when I know almost for certain that I was gone maybe an hour, even with the insane crowds. 

Then he asks me if *insert guy FRIENDS name here* lives in town. This guy friend I was video chatting with one day, he was at work, boss approached him, he shut off his camera. But hubby walked into the kitchen then. He swears I was hiding my phone....it was on the kitchen windowsill in plain view. This friend is married and has kids. Never been anything more than a friend. Not even thought for a millisecond.

Anyway, told hubby AGAIN that no the friend lives out of state and I haven't spoken to him in like 2 weeks, he responded I said 2 weeks last time. It's 4:30 in the fucking morning and I wasn't asleep till after 10. So I respond ""oh you're right my math is off then"" and he comes back ""or you're lying to me, you like to do that."" I say ""I swear I haven't talked to him"" then asked him what kind of energy drinks he wanted.

Him leaving for work after that was normal. I'm exhausted. I'm angry. I want to scream. Want to just be done.


Last night was a joke too. My dog is 12. She's been having a couple bladder issues and she was down on his air mattress (he insists on having one under our lofted bed) She accidentally threw up on his bed/him. So he started screaming and then says ""she better not come back in here tonight. She's losing her bladder and throwing up everywhere. How long are we gonna put up with her incompetence""....yes he was honestly suggesting she be put down...she's in fine health otherwise....just old 


And if you've read my other posts I know I've said I'm planning on getting out. I am. It's just taking a little while because huge wrenches keep getting tossed in that disrupt my timeline. Also I'm terrified as hell because many instances I haven't posted here. And honestly the physical blow ups and reactions continue to worsen. I'm physically sick frequently. He's trying to push a pregnancy now on top of bar none the most stressful month of my life concerning our family/house/living situation. If anyone has been in a long term abusive relationship you know its hard and I'll take any advice but I swear to God I'm trying my best. Harder yet realizing I've no idea how I'd survive on my $800 of social security again knowing I'm drowning in credit card collections with trashed credit because I could only juggle so much and he did what he did last year.


If you've made it this far with me...thank you

EDIT: I am in touch with the local domestic violence shelter and have been since late last year. So I'm making Headway on that front. No I cannot go stay with my mom because my mom lives with me there are three other people in our house the house is legally in my mom's name and it comes down to it he will have to be removed from the house.

Edit 2: last month we received a letter from the railroad company that bought the railroad behind our house. They struck a deal with the local Village that ended up with us needing to empty and take down two large sheds that had 20-plus years of personal belongings in them which are now on pallets and under tarps in the backyard until we can sort through it all. Because of this dirty deal struck by The Village because of their distaste for my family I have been putting my body through complete physical hell that I should not be doing according to my chiropractor because of the dangers to my health due to my disability. I will be physically paying for the effort I've been putting in for quite a while and because of this and his insistence that he has a real job and no one else does he has hopes no more than 2 hours with the entire ordeal and we were only given a month to do all this even though putting up the shed took more than 8 weeks, we have asked for an extension which we will find out about later today. As insane as it sounds I knew myself well enough to know that I could not deal with the huge issues going on with my house and with him or I would have had a complete mental breakdown. So for the sake of the little bit of mental stability I still had I needed to make a choice of which thing to tackle first luckily the issues with the sheds should be over within the next three weeks and then I can focus all my energy on getting him out",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v1mw2w/i_think_im_going_crazy/

I was driving in a quiet residential neighbourhood late at night to get to a friend's house. Everyone on the streets had their garbage and recycling bins out and one was knocked over with everything spilling out. I tried to dodge it but I felt my car go over a bump. As I looked in the rearview mirror I see something that looks like an animal. 

I immediately stop and as soon as I open the door I'm hit by the smell of skunk. Once I confirm it's dead I get back in my car and start freaking out. I've never hit anything before and the idea that I just killed something hit me hard. I called my friend to tell him I'll be a little late and as soon as he picks up I start bawling my eyes out. I tried to tell him what happened as best I can while crying. My friend asks me if I want him to call someone and I say yes. I'm thinking he means the city or whoever you call to report roadkill. I tell him exactly where I am and he tells me to stay put he'll call me right back. 

Less than 10 minutes go by and I hear sirens. Shortly after, police pull in behind me. Ambulance and fire arrive shortly after. Now it's close to 1am and people are starting to come out of their houses and the street is packed. Police officers are telling me to roll my windows down and looking around my car. Paramedics and firefighters are doing the same thing. Bear in mind the horrendous smell they're all dealing with. They get to my window and I'm still crying but extremely confused so I start to tell them what happened and they keep asking where is he? I get out and point to the skunk and all hell breaks loose. They start yelling at me asking if I'm pranking them and telling me I committed a crime. 

Between their disparagements I realized that they were responding to a homicide. I called my friend and realized that he thought I killed someone. In my distressed state all he could make out was ""oh my God I hit him he's dead oh my God"" and lots of crying and swearing. 

The mix-up had to be explained to everyone around, including all the neighbours that came outside their house. Police were pissed off and gave me a very long lecture, but ultimately decided not to charge me. The kicker - one of the neighbours heard the story and gave me an odd look and said the skunk's been there a few hours, they already left a message about it. The bump was from the spilled recycling. The police get mad again and eventually yelled at me to leave. All in all, it was a valuable learning experience to text when I'm crying. 

TL;DR: I was on the way to a friend's house and hit a skunk. I called my friend crying to tell him I'll be late and what happened and he said he'll call someone. Police, firefighters and paramedics show up and a bunch of neighbours came outside. Turns out my friend thought I hit someone and called 911. A neighbor said the skunk had already been there and I didn't even hit it, I just hit something that fell out of a recycling bin. Got yelled at for wasting resources but they ultimately decided to not charge me with anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v1n8pd/tifu_by_accidentally_turning_myself_in_for/

12 man Nightfalls and Raids were just stupid, STUPID amounts of fun. 

Were they easy? Of course. But I feel like Solstice, as a celebration of everything Guardian, is the perfect time of year to allow for that kind of chicanery.

I think the game is kinda begging for larger team activities, especially considering how many people you used to be able to take into WoW raids and the like, but this is more of a ""alright kids, you go have fun and break everything"" kind of thing.


Edit: 

Zavala: ""Guardians: It has come to my attention that a number of New Lights have been making quite a fuss about the Vanguards strict engagement protocols. Limitations on fireteam size to 3 for strike and Nifhtfall operations and 6 for more esoteric missions have apparently felt...""claustrophobic"", and have additionally been called into question by our esteemed allies on the Cabal War Council. 

It is understandable, as few New Lights have clear knowledge of why the Luna Command and later the Taeko Protocols were enacted in the first place: the potential for that many unprepared guardians to meet their final end at once was too high a risk for the Vanguard to accept. 

That said...in recent years, our ranks have swelled, not just in number, but in raw power. New Lights of this day display exponential power growth compared to guardians even just 2 years ago, and there are so many more of us now. We are no longer simply a hunkering, defensive force; we are a vast army of Guardians, laying waste to our foes on all fronts. 


As such, the Vanguard is temporarily modifying engagement restrictions for our Guardian forces during this year's Solstice. Effective immediately, Taekeo-3 protocols are rescinded on all Raid and Nightfall operations, and up to 12 Guardians may tackle any task we set forth. 

Remeber, guardians, each one of you is worth a legion of Caitial's Phalanxes; lets give her a good demonstration of what 12 legions worth of Gurdians can do.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/v1j98h/bungie_with_solstice_coming_up_its_time_for_you/

I could actually choose between meals, will get them 3 times a day, everyone is ready to speak english when my sloppy german is not good enough.

No shouting, no rush. Patient, friendly nurses and doctors. My experience so far has been such an opposite to this until now, I actually had a stomach ache knowing that I will have to spend days in a public hospital. I was ready for hell...

Your country is truly a wonder guys. I hope soon I can call it our country. My german is nowhere near good enough to express myself properly, so please forgive me to post it in english.

Äntligen! Vad jag har saknat Sverige. 

Cykelvägar, ren luft, snälla grannar, regelbundet väder, natur, jämställdhet, bra löner, person-nummer, bankID, långsammare och bättre trafikhastigheter, läroplaner för skolorna, yttrandefrihet, systembolaget, gratis universitetsutbildning, kollektivavtal. 

Ja, alla länder har sina negativa sidor, även Sverige. Det finns uteliggare, tiggare, människor som inte bryr sig om att bli integrerade, dåliga löner, kriminalitet, gängbråk, ""ghettos"", höga skatter, avgifter.

Men att Sverige håller på att ""gå under"" är helt osant. Storbritannien har alla de negativa sidorna jag nämnde, och nästan inga av de positiva. Och då ska Storbritannien vara ett rätt så bra land ändå. 

Alla har vi rätt till att kritisera, klaga och vara olyckliga. När det finns brist på verkliga problem, så kommer vi hitta problem någon annanstans. Det är helt förståeligt! Men snälla jag ber er att överväga hur bra Sverige egentligen är. Många här beter sig så otacksamt att det nästan är pinsamt.

Det är mycket möjligt att jag har simplifierat de negativa sidorna för att problemen kan vara större än vad de låter. Men att säga att Sverige är sämst, Sverige går under, Sverige kommer inte att överleva, samhällskollapsen är nära är helt vansinnigt.

Dedalus Diggle gives him an excited wave and lifts his hat to Uncle Vernon from the street corner.

For my PLT, we are supposed to have our webcameras on majority of the time. However, my daughter is still breast fed and the reason for me undertaking the PLT online is to care for her.

During one session she was a bit sick and her feeding schedule was off, and I let the lecturer that day know. So, when I turned my camera off, everything should’ve been fine, right?

Apparently not because the lecturer called me out in the middle of class and I reminded them of my earlier email. He said that while he agreed to me feeding my daughter, I needed to be in front of the camera with it turned on so that he knew I was paying attention. I turned on my mic and said “I am currently breast feeding my daughter, but if you insist you’ve gotta be prepared for it” he said he did. I turned it on and he went beet red and his mouth flapped like a fish and said “okay turn your camera off til you’re done”.

He didn’t comment again if I turned my camera off :)

Edit:

Hey guys, wow this blew up way more than I expected. I just thought it was a bit of a funny story and my fiancé told me I should post about it. Thanks for the award! 

To address some recurring comments:
- Discrimination or not, it isn’t worth pursuing legally
- as I am not in the US, it is not the subject of a title IX claim
- he was one of 5 guest lecturers for my course, and even if he was an actual employee I’d have no interest in ruining his career.
- as some have pointed out, he likely assumed it was a lie and when his assumption was proven wrong he was embarrassed 
- I wasn’t flashing the class, I simply angled the camera to where all you could see was the top of bubs head and my face.

Dear AAM,

We had a pandemic baby and we decided for safety reasons it was better to be exposed to one person (a nanny) versus the potentially hundreds in a daycare setting. The expense for even 40 hours of her time is a tight squeeze for us, but we’ve found someone who is overall fantastic. Our baby does amazing with her, she’s knowledgeable, experienced, helpful, and taking the kinds of precautions we need and expect.

I manage people at work but have never had in-home help until now, and I have no role models for this because we are just not of an income bracket where I’ve ever been around nannies. She feels different than someone I would manage at work because the lines blur a lot — she’s in our home, caring for our baby, eating lunch with us, etc. We also can’t afford to lose her — there just aren’t that many folks who fit our needs out there right now.

The issue is this. She’s lost some serious weight. I’m talking 100+ pounds, and she’s still going. I am happy for her because she seems happy about it, and I understand the commitment a change like that takes — it can be all-consuming. That said, she comments on every single food we eat and bring into our house, and not favorably. While we eat reasonably healthfully and are active and healthy weights, we do have junk food in our house and not every meal is perfectly balanced and nutritious. As a working mom, my priority is first ease and second cost. Nutrition matters, too, but it’s definitely not the only consideration. Also, we have a new baby in a pandemic! Every night I cook at all feels heroic and we eat some treats only because they’re tasty.

I’ve tried hinting, “We eat everything in moderation here” or “We want to teach \[baby\] that foods aren’t good or bad, and all bodies are good bodies” and finally, “I can’t really talk about food and weight this much; it’s not healthy for me.” She doesn’t get it.

I sort of lost it when I saw her snap a photo of our snack drawer presumably to show someone what pigs we are but I didn’t say anything because I needed to work.

How do I address this in a way that puts a stop to it, is blunt enough to be clear, but doesn’t sour our relationship and make things awkward? If I were in an office, I’d know what to do but I’m honestly at a loss here.

&#x200B;

**Update** 

So, I really appreciated the commenter’s perspectives about the opportunity costs involved – in finding a nanny during COVID and finding trusted, qualified childcare in general. I also appreciated your feedback about jumping to termination without really HAVING this conversation.

I had a conversation with her where I said, essentially, that the focus on our food choices felt uncomfortable for me. She was honestly very vulnerable in sharing that she was able to lose so much weight by simply never giving herself access to any treats and being in our home was very disorienting to her. She definitely had some fears that she was projecting, and I probably also had some insecurities that didn’t mix well there. After talking, she definitely was able to reflect and see how this came across, and we talked about shared expectations around food. I mentioned that I would be happy to keep any treats she found inordinately distracting out of line-of-sight and away from the foods she and the baby were accessing. I also mentioned that I would always include her in our grocery and meal planning and make sure we had options that were appealing to her and fit her goals, per your recommended script. We also talked about food/body/diet talk around the baby as she became more verbal and she really seemed to understand. We also talked about photos taken in our home and parameters for sharing them, as well as just discussing our family with anyone else. It did turn out that the photos she took were so she could investigate how they fit into her diet, something she didn’t want to spend time doing at work. I have not seen her do that again.

We don’t always execute this perfectly, but I think that conversation set a good baseline and we can return to those mutually agreeable principles whenever this is out of alignment. She’s been an amazing nanny and I would hate to have made a hasty decision based on behavior I didn’t fully understand. Things are going really well! So thankful for your support and perspective as well as the readers’.

I'm smooth brained and have only on my 5th coffee, but this is the real sliding to me right now.  

Just type ""Gamestop"" in Google.

I think this is actually bad actors  smashing search with negative phrases to have the following pop upfront in search results in the ""People also ask"".

Check out all the negative questions apparently people are asking that would mislead.

Expand any of these ""searches"" from the card to find the answer and they take you to the dumpster behind Wendy's in Shilltown.

Just like this:

It get's a lot lot worse but I can't bear myself to spread the Mayo flavored FUD.

Try it for yourself.  Google the one word.

&#x200B;

Why are we not seeing the real questions in Google like: 

&#x200B;

""How is Ryan Cohen transforming Gamestop?"" 

""What vision does Ryan Cohen have for GameStop?""

""Why did Volition Capital invest in Gamestop?""

""Why is the Gamestop and Loopring partnership seen by some as a gamechanger?""

""What does the Gamestop and Immutable X partnership mean?""

""Why is everyone direct registering their Gamestop shares?""

""Do people think shorts are lying about closing their positions on Gamestop?""

""How do hedge funds use ETF's to short Gamestop?""

""Why are hedge funds illegally shorting companies like Gamestop?""

""How many synthetic shares have been sold of Gamestop?""

""Why is Gamestop a popular topic on Reddit?""

 ""Why do we see media articles predict Gamestop price movements before they actually happen?""

 ""Why do some media outlets hide large increases in the Gamestop share price?""

""How do I make a CokeRat NFT in my Gamestop Wallet and share it?"" 

&#x200B;

All food for thought.  Just got me wondering what other questions people would really ask?  

Not everyone gets their answers from Reddit and they are lead to this dumpster fire of misinformation.

Anyways gonna hit the Google again and figure out that Gamestop wallet thingy, this time without distraction.

Party scouts mind flayer lair.

they do very well stay undetected but ultimatly decide not to take it on.

next session.

Player who was missing last session is there today.

explain how the party decided mind flayers too scawwy and will leave.

Player ""no i wanna go check myself""

he goes alone, Lvl 7 cleric 

party ""what no dont do that""

player objects ""i dont tell them i just go while they rest""

ok fine.

explain how he sees some guard posts set up, with slaves and singular mind flayers for every 5 slaves, tell him he can see the main entrance heavily guarded.

mfw, he say he just goes to the main entrance.

everyone silent waiting to see how this will unfold.

me: ""what do you do? draw ur weapon? cast a spell?""

player ""no ill just go in and check for myself""

confused screaming in my head.

mind flayers confused what that idiot is doing, notice he is alone.

once he is too close gets captured.

some describing of the insides as he is brought somewhere.

he gets restrained by the mind flayers on an operating table.

player ""can i escape?""

me: ""uh... u can try make an athletics check""

rolls 3

player ""hmm okay, just tell me when i have an opportunity to escape""

mfw, he actually thinks his character will survive this.

describe in horrific detail how his head gets opened and his brain consumed as everything fades to black.

Hand him the playerhandbook.

me ""here make urself a new character""

player very much surprised ""what.. wait.. i died? what noo""

everyone else""WHAT did you expect u knew they were evil and dangerouse"" 

player ""no thats unfair you just killed me on purpose i couldent do anything""

mfw, he actually gets so upset he leaves and starts his own group where he is the DM and ask my regulars to play there because he wont just kill their characters.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/v1o71j/player_doesent_expect_to_die_when_doing_something/

**Tl;DR The reason Thor and Korg go to Sakaar is to recruit the Grandmaster’s former champion Beta Ray Bill to help them take on Gorr the God Butcher.** 

**Powerful Allies for a Powerful Villian**

Based on the trailer for the upcoming Thor film, I have a little theory. In the trailer, we see Thor visit both Olympia and Sakaar. Olympia Makes sense, the film is about the eradication of gods, and there are a ton of them in Olympia, but Sakaar makes less sense. Why return to a place with nothing to offer the two and that they had to escape from before in Thor Ragnorok? To me, there is only one reason. Beta Ray Bill.

**Thor is Recruiting**

I believe Thor goes to Olympia to recruit gods to help defeat Gorr, but true to form, the Greek gods are vain and self-serving and don’t offer Thor any help. After the Greek’s refusal and their inevitable destruction, Korg suggests going to Sakaar to recruit a former Champion of the Grandmaster. Beta Ray Bill. Beta Ray Bill is worthy of Mjolnir, but he will most likely be a powerful ally. He may have even replaced the Grandmaster as the ruler of Sakaar,

**The Three Thors**

This Beta Ray Bill recruitment could fulfill a cool part of Jason Aaron’s comic in a fun twist. In the comic, three Thors fight Gorr the god butcher. In the comic, it’s Thor from the past, present, and future, but in the MCU, it could be the Mighty Thor, Thor Odinson, and Beta Ray Bill.

Outliers either went a little faster or slower, changing up some of the general steps. One constant, however, was the method of FTL travel. Each successful sapient spacefarer utilized the tried and true wormhole drive. Everyone had varying levels of safety, but overall it had a 75% success rate; Not excellent, not terrible. The most skillful species had success rates of up to 99%.

Humanity has a success rate of 100%, but they achieved it in a way so reckless and downright insane that the entire galaxy has still refused to adopt it. They call it ""True Vacuum Utilization"", while the name doesn't sound like much, it really is something to behold.

The process takes many years, sometimes centuries to properly perform, but once established it works perfectly. The process is as follows:

&#x200B;

Step 1- Lay down a path with slower than light construction drones. This step prevents the complete annihilation of the surrounding universe, making it the most important regarding safety.

Step 2- Implement thermodynamics defying shield capacitors. Pretty much the same as step one, makes sense to humans.

Step 3- Create a Dyson sphere, or generate similar power output, (Penrose sphere or a kugelblitz). The concept of a kugelblitz is unknown to the galactic community, humans have yet to properly explain its function. Apparently, they make a black hole by using a lot of concentrated light? The idea doesn't make much sense, but humans are adamant about their existence.

Step 4- Power the thermodynamics defying shield capacitors with an insane energy device.

Step 5- Unleash synthesized strange matter into a kugelblitz within the shield. This triggers what the humans call a ""False Vacuum Decay"". As with much of human theory, we have no idea what they are attempting to explain. How does the vacuum turn into not a vacuum that breaks physics somehow?

Step 6- Use the thermodynamics defying properties of the no longer false vacuum to power the thermodynamics defying shield capacitors. Somehow this also generates excess energy that can be used elsewhere. It is thermodynamics defying after all.

Step 7- Encase ships within ""False Vacuum Bubbles"" within the true vacuum and move as quickly as you want. This is the FTL step. There is no speed limit within a true vacuum, no sensible physical concept of space or time either; making it possible to move infinite distance over an infinitely small amount of time. Physics no longer applies, humans don't even know the reason for this one.

Step 8- Profit, literally. You can now create infinite energy out of nothing, as well as travel faster than light.

&#x200B;

Now that humans have contacted the rest of the galactic community, they've attained some of the standardized FTL drives. Now instead of relying on slower than light drones to set up their FTL highways, they use FTL drones. The construction of the human space highways has only sped up as a result, worrying everyone but the humans. They don't seem to think the risks outweigh the rewards.

Now humans consistently pester the galaxy, asking us for permission to build highways through our own sovereign territory. They tell us how safe their technologies are as reassurance, but in the very next sentence tell us of all its dangers. In the infamous words of the human scientist Robert Finkov,

""Our FTL allows for instantaneous and safe travel across the stars. Please note, however, that in the unlikely event of failure, the entire unshielded universe will be deleted from existance by an invisible force moving at the speed of light.""

Needless to say, no one has taken them up on their offer as of yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/v1qt4z/human_ftl_is_insane/

I hope everyone had an enjoyable weekend over the holiday. Cause we are now back in the shit. I covered most of my expectations for this coming week in the DD over the weekend and also in the live Q&A stream. If you guys haven't gotten a chance I suggest you check them out.

[Weekend DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/PickleFinancial/comments/v0vtlr/compounding_risk_and_agm_guidebook/)

[Q&A Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GnI9wpjUtY)

I wanted to note that although there is no economic data coming out today Biden and Powell will be meeting for the first time since Powell's reappointment. Also the Feds program of QT (quantitative tightening) begins tomorrow and could have an effect on the current relief rally we are seeing.

Also in other good news our favorite Estonian got there shit together and updated our DIX.

[Next Key upside resistance at 150 and 158.50](https://preview.redd.it/wivrr0w86t291.png?width=1941&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e126d8f917abe3b02d4692516ddcab7d670f50)

With the massive put pressure to the downside a slip below 130 could break the current bullish trend.

**DIX Pics**

[Finally with the utilization update we can see they shed a big chunk of utilization last Wednesday but it began to pick up again Friday into close. This may give them a little extra control over the price than we thought. I would say that this still tracks our expectations from over the weekend. But it is nice to have the extra data.](https://preview.redd.it/9wi5lhsp6t291.png?width=2433&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dd75298a9a22e45baee2c798a84a45a6a638b53)

# Pre-Market Analysis

Solid morning volume indicates that we have not left the spiciness from last week behind yet. Although it does look like we are a bit at the mercy of active funds in the pre-market. Tracking the SPY's downside a little bit into open. Longs still remain very much in control of the price in this range. We have support to the downside at 132 a slip below 130 could trigger that gamma slide so watch that key resistance point.

**Oscillators**

[The explosion of DMI + over the prevailing trend is compelling and tracks the initial phase of the March run. MACD continues to look strong. TTM breaking to the upside. Oscillators especially on the daily lag behind and this is something we would expect following a rapid bullish reversal. I don't know if there is too much to take away from this. ](https://preview.redd.it/xl031xqfat291.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8a3f7ef5aac81ab8ba2cf2b7ba86abcea98220)

After seeing u/morriscox [post about](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/v184sz/rules_of_tech_support_users_will_20220530/) their [Rules of Tech Support](https://github.com/morriscox/Rules-of-Tech-Support) I thought I should share a list I'd been compiling for a few years given there is some overlap of similar rules. Additions are welcome.

# [The Tenets of IT](https://github.com/DavidBrightSparc/Tenets-of-IT)

1. Reboot, reinstall, replace.
2. Rebooting is a band aid. Figure out why you had to.
3. It's always DNS.
4. When it’s not DNS, it’s MTU.
5. When it’s not MTU, it’s BGP.
6. When it’s not BGP, it’s LACP.
7. Under-promise, over-deliver.
8. Plan for the worst, hope for the best.
9. Always implement two-factor-authentication, no matter how loudly the users complain.
10. Have the user show you the problem, often it is the user doing something in an unusual way.
11. Fast. Cheap. Good. You may pick one, two if you're lucky.
12. Never stop learning.
13. The Six Ps: Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance.
14. It's always an emergency, until it incurs an extra charge.
15. Everyone has a test environment, not everyone is lucky enough to have a separate production environment.
16. If anyone can't find the documentation it's not documented, if it's not documented it doesn't exist.
17. If you think it's going to be a disaster, get it in writing and CYA.
18. Poor planning on a users part, does not constitute an emergency on yours.
19. Fridays are read-only. (aka - no changes on a Friday)
20. A backup isn't a backup until you've restored successfully from it.
21. Snapshots are not backups.
22. If a backup isn't off-site, it isn't a backup.
23. If it isn't in a ticket, it's not getting done.
24. Treat all users the same, regardless of their last name.
25. It's never a ""5 minute thing"".
26. Security and ease of use.. rarely walk hand in hand.
27. *""Not my circus, not my monkeys.""*
28. Everybody lies.
29. Never ask a user a question that you can easily confirm yourself.
30. The fastest path to resolution first requires removing the user from the problem. (aka isolate layer 8)
31. You are replaceable at work, no matter how highly you think of yourself. You are not replaceable at home.
32. Never give a web developer/designer access to the DNS.
33. Own up to your mistakes. That way, when it isn’t your fault, people will believe you.
34. If you have to do something twice, automate it.
35. Never spend 6 minutes doing something manually, that you spend 6 hours failing to automate.
36. To make an error is human. To propagate an error to all servers in an automatic way is devops.
37. Skilled IT professionals will continuously be given more work, until they can do none of it skilfully.
38. Give me a new hire that is a blank slate and willing to learn, over a seasoned tech that hates this job and doesn't want to learn or change.
39. IT time is relative.
40. Yes it's free/cheap. No, it's not going in the server room.
41. You provide the problem and business case, let IT provide the solution.
42. IT's job is to solve people problems with technology.
43. Technology can't solve people problems.
44. Nothing is more permanent than a temporary expedient.
45. Fix the problem now, it's just going to happen again when it's less convenient.
46. If the network guys say it's not the network, there is an 80% chance it's the network.
47. Traceroute is your friend.
48. 80% of the time CAPEX becomes OPEX when you can get 0% financing. Accounting HATES CAPEX.
49. If it doesn't log automatically make it log! Log's just spit out the answer for you!
50. There are some jobs and clients you must walk away from.
51. If you can smell the magic smoke, you’re already screwed.
52. ""Working just fine"" and ""too screwed to log an error"" look an awful lot alike.
53. The longer everything goes according to plan, the bigger the impending disaster.
54. Sales Engineers are a gift from heaven, they prevent salespeople from over-promising.
55. Printers have moods, most of the time that mood is 'Fuck you'.

I lys av dette har jeg, sammen med gode kolleger, gått i dybden på flere av problemstillingene dere pekte på. I dag går vi ut sammen med over 20 andre forbrukerorganisasjoner fra 18 land og krever bedre forbrukerbeskyttelse i spillmarkedet.

Forbrukerrådet, og jeg personlig, er for spilling, men er imot utnyttelsen av forbrukere. Vårt mål er kort sagt at det skal være trygt å spille – både for barn, ungdom og voksne spillere! 

Les hele rapporten og se film her: [https://www.forbrukerradet.no/report-on-loot-boxes-insert-coin/](https://www.forbrukerradet.no/report-on-loot-boxes-insert-coin/) Saken er allerede dekt hos [Gamer.no](https://www.gamer.no/artikler/forbrukerradet-roper-varsko-et-klart-behov-for-a-regulere-lootbokser/514931) og [Tek.no](https://www.tek.no/nyheter/nyhet/i/5GapGm/vil-begrense-og-muligens-forby-lootbokser-fra-spill).

Takk til folka på Reddit for gullgode innspill, som bidro i arbeidet vårt!

Nå ønsker vi gjerne å høre hva deres synes om rapporten? Er løsningsforslagene gode? Er problemstillingene godt belyst? Alle innspill tas imot med åpne armer!

 Ikke minst tar vi alltid imot enda flere innspill. Her er det bare å fyre løs!  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/norge/comments/v1k5dz/ny_rapport_fra_forbrukerrådet_om_lootboxer/

At the vanguard of DeFi, GameFi and Social Finance.

TG: https://t.me/TheWeb3Project

Website: https://www.theweb3project.com

This are some of the first utilities that will come out:

🔥Whistle - Decentralized Lifestyle

Comparing with titano, libero, safuu, we are:

1. Higher

103,864,155,400.73% APY + 475.65% APR

2. Faster

Rewarded EVERY 3 SECONDS

Gives 5% daily (103,864,155,400.73% APY + 475.65% APR)

Other projects give reward in every 15 or 30 minutes or more due to their limitation.

People have to wait that next 15 or 30 minute period to get next reward before doing something.

Our project divides reward into smaller portions and give reward every 3 seconds.

You cannot miss or wait any reward as this is theoretical maximum speed based on block

by combining with the APY, it gives higher reward than any other projects.

3. More Safe

Others use EOA wallet for burn. No one knows they have key to control that wallet or not.

Our burn address is a verifiable contract which has no owner.

4. More Stable

We have same manual buyback like others.

But we also have auto-buyback for each sell

5. More Healthy

Others have big price drop when adding LP.

We do not.

6. More Consistent

Unlike others, we have fixed exponential decay of interest rate change at each year.

meaning we have fixed rate for 1 year and changes every each year.

7. More Sustainable

Others have price drop at each rebase.

We have not. We have a special algorithm to avoid this (testing)

Don't miss out!

Yes.

# Layer 2

Yes...with some exceptions.

**If you are a high winrate Arena player or heroic Duels player**, Arena/Duels can be a more efficient way to spend gold.

**If you are new or returning to the game, and don't have all the commons yet**, packs are the higher short term priority.  2000 gold for the mini-set gets you 32 commons (2 copies of the 16 commons in the mini-set), 2000 gold spent on packs gets you 72 commons.  If you can manage to get both great!  But if you only have gold for one option...packs will build up your collection faster when you are very early into your collection.

# Layer 3

If you buy the mini-set, and then dust everything immediately, it's worth 2520 dust.  1600 from dusting 4 legendaries.  200 from dusting 2 epics.  560 from dusting 28 rares.  160 from dusting 32 commons.

Using the aggregated card probability statistics drawn from about 33k pack openings aggregated [on the hearthstone wiki](https://hearthstone.fandom.com/wiki/Card_pack_statistics) we get the following probabilities for each card in a hearthstone pack

|common|rare|epic|legendary|golden c|golden r|golden e|golden l|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|70.14%|21.51%|4.19%|1.00%|1.49%|1.33%|0.25%|0.09%|


Which means if we dust every card we open from a hearthstone pack, on average we get 20.54 dust per card, or 102.7 dust per pack.  The dust value of 20 packs is thus 2054.

2520 (mini-set) is bigger than 2054 (packs) therefore mini set bigger number.

**If you are a wild player, or you only play one class and dust everything from other classes, you can stop here**.  Just buy the thing that gives you the most dust (a.k.a. the mini-set).

# Layer 4

Ok, so presumably most people don't actually buy 20 packs and disenchant everything opened immediately.  Or buy the mini-set only to immediately disenchant every card.

When you buy a pack, there's a chance you open epic and legendary cards that you wanted, or that maybe you didn't personally want but which will get nerfed.

Looking through meta relevant cards, looks like there's about 16/25 legendaries that are arguably meta relevant from Voyage to the Sunken City, not counting the 2/25 that were given out for free, 13/25 epics that are good to open in Voyage to the Sunken City.  So if you play all the meta decks, you probably end up using about...half the epics and legendaries you open in packs.

This means that if you play all or most of the classes in standard, the net value of opening an epic is maybe half-way between 100 (insta-dust) and 400 (woulda crafted that).  Similarly, the net value of opening a legendary is maybe half-way between 400 (insta-dust) and 1600 (woulda crafted that).

Plugging 250 dust for the value of an epic from a pack, and 1000 dust for the value of a legendary from a pack into the formula above raises the dust value of a pack to...

164.1 dust

(up from 102.7 dust if we dust everything instantly).

So quite a bit more valuable if you actually use half the epics/legendaries you open from packs.

But wait, there's more.  Some percentage of cards get nerfed each set and get full dust refunds.  How many?  IDK, maybe about 7% of the cards in a set.  This raises the values of golden cards, as well as duplicate commons and rares you open.  By my estimate this puts the dust value of a pack somewhere around...

185.7

(up from 164.1)

Multiply that by 20 and the dust value of 20 packs is at 3713.

""But wait"" you say, ""mini-set cards can get nerfed or end up in decks too.""  And you are right.  But, unlike card packs, we can see what cards are in the mini-set before we buy.  And if all of them look bad...that's going to lower the value.

That said, if nothing from the mini-set gets nerfed, but even one single mini-set legendary is useful to you, a card you would have crafted, the dust value of that specific legendary goes from 400 to 1600 in the mini-set, and the dust value of the overall mini-set jumps to at least 3720 (more valuable than 20 packs).

Basically, **if a single legendary in the mini-set is a legendary you would use, then the mini-set is worth it, even if you dust every other card**.  If you want a single legendary from the mini-set, you can stop reading here, it's worth-it, get the mini-set.

# Layer 5

OK, so this part only applies to people who think all 4 of the legendaries in the mini-set are bad, or just never going to be used by them.  (And people who ALSO use about half of the epics and legendaries they open from packs, a.k.a. not a wild player, and not someone who ignores most of the classes).

Saving gold and not buying the mini-set...starts looking like an option, but wait, there's additional stuff to calculate!

**How are you getting the commons and rares from the mini-set?**

If your answer is ""just buy sunken city packs"" that...might not be efficient--it takes about 25 packs on average to get 2 copies of all 14 rares from the mini-set (28 rares)--buying that with gold would cost 2500.  Now, luckily in this case the end of season rewards come out at a similar time to the mini-set.  If you save your end of season rewards and your tavern brawl standard packs for after the mini-set comes out, you can bring this number down quite a bit.

**How much lower value are Sunken City packs after the mini-set?**

There are several factors that will make Sunken City packs lower value after the mini-set than they were at launch.

* You may have crafted some cards, lowering the percentage of valuable cards you can open from packs.
* The nerf windows for several cards from sunken city have already passed.
* Players in this category want lots of legendaries from packs, but zero legendaries from the mini-set, and now the mini-set legendaries are lowering the odds of pulling the legendaries they want from packs.

Let's say you've missed all the nerf windows, and the percentage of valueable cards you can open is down from 50% of epics and legendaries to 25% of epics and legendaries.

This makes the net value of buying a sunken city pack now around 133.4 dust.  (Down from 185.7 at launch).  Although...the commons and rares you open are still reasonably likely to get nerfed, since a bunch of those will be mini set cards, bump that up to 153.4 dust.

Let's say you have no packs saved up, your free sources of cards this week probably include something like...

* 1 tavern brawl pack
* 7 rares from hitting diamond 5
* 4 sunken city packs from hitting diamond 5

This gets you 12.7 of the rares from the mini-set, so you'd still be on the hook for 15.3 rares.  That's about 13 packs, or 1300 gold.  But 13 packs we're being inefficient with (153.4 average dust, compared to the pack launch value of 185.7)

So that wouldn't be a perfectly efficient use of gold; maybe bleeding 400-500 net dust.  But...maybe less of a loss than the mini-set if we really are in the scenario where all the legendaries and epics are actually not relevant (maybe 1100 dust of inefficiency).

Alright, but what about the fact that for the rest of the two year cycle, you'll have four more legendary lowrolls out of standard packs and sunken city packs; how much does that hit for?

This is out of...hold on I'll use my own collection as an example, about 60 legendaries I don't have in standard.  Which...lowers the dust value of packs by...about 1.  (This is going with the assumption that the cards from standard packs are mostly cards from old sets, so only about 25% of them would be nice to open.  So going from 15/60 legendaries we want to open, to 15/64 legendaries we want to open).

So...22 months of opening standard packs and old packs from rewards tracks like this, 4-5 Tavern Brawl packs per month, 4-5 end of season rewards packs, some number of event and rewards track packs, let's say about 10 packs per month, at 1 dust less per pack that's...220 dust.

So...is it worth it to skip the mini-set if you want nothing from the mini-set, but do want quite a few cards from packs?  

If you don't want any of the legendaries, or the epic from the mini set, and also want a substantial number (50%+) of epics and legendaries you open from packs, and are confident that also none of the epics or legendaries from the mini-set will ever get nerfed (or buffed) and you manage to use your end of season rewards to get about half the mini-set rares from pack openings, yes there is technically a scenario where skipping the mini-set is the equivalent of saving...about 300 gold?

> Following a standout season from Rookie of the Year Scottie Barnes, word has circulated among rival front offices that Anunoby grew dissatisfied at times with his role in Toronto, where Barnes joined Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet as the primary ball-handlers in Nick Nurse's offense. 

> Two sources with knowledge of the dynamic told B/R that Anunoby has not directly expressed discontent with his situation with the Raptors. Perhaps the conversation around him has been driven more by external interest in acquiring the fifth-year forward's services.

> If Anunoby becomes available this offseason, expect a long list of interested suitors. Anunoby, 24, is a proven blue-chip prospect who already has deep postseason experience. He's also playing under a value contract, not even halfway through the four-year, $72 million extension he signed in 2020 (with a player option in 2024-25).

> Two landing spots already linked by league personnel have been Utah and Portland.

#Rep. Mooney

The U.S. House of Representatives Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) released a report last week documenting numerous violations of House rules and federal law by Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV).

According to the OCE [report](https://s3.amazonaws.com/wvmetro-uploads-prod/2022/05/Mooney-OCE-5-23-2022.pdf?x21864), Mooney accepted impermissible gifts from a campaign vendor in the form of a vacation
to Aruba. The company, HSP Direct, paid for “nearly all [the family’s] lodging, meals, drinks and amenities while staying at the Ritz-Carlton, Aruba,” totaling over $10,800. The congressman also used a house on Capitol Hill associated with HSP Direct at no cost.

Mooney assigned his campaign and congressional staff with personal tasks, ranging from “babysitting, to automotive repair work on personal vehicles, to assisting Rep. Mooney and his wife with their personal finances and businesses.” They were “almost never compensated for this work.”

> Former Staffer 1 told the OCE that at some time every staff member was asked to perform
personal errands for Rep. Mooney or his family, but that staff members in certain positions,
such as schedulers or those who worked for both the campaign and the official office, were
required to perform personal errands on a daily basis.100 Former Staffer 1 stated, “I think the
understanding is: If you work on the campaign, you also work for the Mooney family. You
were at their beck and call for anything, even though you got official salary as well.”...

>Several staff members, primarily young women, were asked to watch Rep. Mooney’s
daughter while he was present in the office, sometimes for hours at a time…In addition to babysitting, staff reported chauffeuring the children and Rep. Mooney to social events, recreational activities, and community college classes…When the Mooneys were unable to watch their dog Skipper, they asked Former Staffer 3 to drive Skipper from their home in Charles Town, West Virginia to Dr. Mooney’s parents’ home in Bethesda, Maryland. Former Staffer 3 could not recall how many times this
occurred but told the OCE that it happened on several occasions…

Mooney and HSP Direct did not cooperate with the OCE, which does not have subpoena authority. The OCE recommends that the Committee on Ethics issue subpoenas to further the investigation.

#Rep. Cawthorn

The House Ethics Committee unanimously voted last week to impanel a special subcommittee to investigate allegations that Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC) violated House rules by promoting a cryptocurrency while having a personal financial interest invested and engaged ""in an improper relationship"" with a member of his staff.

Late last year, the congressman—who lost his primary—posed with the founder of the “Let’s Go Brandon” meme coin, posting on Instagram ""LGB legends. ... Tomorrow we go to the moon!"" The next day, NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced LGB would be the primary sponsor of his 2022 season, causing the coin’s value to spike by 75%. The coin increased by [97%](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lets-go-brandon/historical-data/) during the 10-day period he held the coin.

In a long-delayed financial filing on Friday, Cawthorn disclosed that he purchased between $100,001 to $250,000 worth of LGB on Dec. 21.

>""This looks like a pretty classic 'pump and dump' scheme,"" [said](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/madison-cawthorn-reaped-profits-with-crypto-pump-and-dump-scheme-filing-shows) Jordan Libowitz, a spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

>""Did he have inside information? It sure appears that way,"" Libowitz told the Washington Examiner. ""He's hanging out with the guy, announced it was going to spike the next day. The next day it spiked, and then he sells a portion of it. We don't know exactly how much he sold since he said it's partial, but he sells it the next day.""

The other matter being investigated by the subcommittee is Cawthorn’s allegedly “improper relationship” with his staffer and younger cousin Stephen L. Smith. The complaint originated from a [video](https://twitter.com/MeidasTouch/status/1519802680985604096?s=20&t=ac1q6abDNeU1h900CCv0hQ) of Smith putting his hand on Cawthorns crotch, captured on video and released as part of a leak campaign ahead of the primaries. The same campaign also [revealed](https://www.newsweek.com/madison-cawthorn-stephen-smith-venmo-messages-1702112) thousands of dollars of undeclared payments and gifts from Cawthorn to Smith with Venmo comments reading “the quickie at the airport” and “Getting naked for me in Sweden.”

#Rep. Jackson

The OCE also released a [report](https://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/documents/OCE%20Report%20and%20Findings_8.pdf) documenting alleged violations of House rules and federal law by Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX). 

Jackson is accused of using campaign funds for personal use — specifically to pay for “unlimited access” to the [Amarillo Club](https://amarilloclub.com/), a private dining club in Texas. Billing statements obtained by the OCE show Jackson spent nearly $6,000 of campaign money on “dues, fees, meals, and other activities at the club.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/v1quri/three_gop_house_lawmakers_under_ethics_committee/

Nastaran was crossing by boat from Turkey to Greece with her parents and siblings when the boat capsized. Nastaran's parents and eighteen year old sister died, but her two other siblings survived and are looking for her as they believe she could have been rescued. Nastaran has black eyes and brown hair, and is 13-14 if still alive today.

[Noraida Saludin Abang](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/noraida-saludin-abang-21-004785) was 35 when she went missing on the 13th August 2012 from Brighton, UK. If she's still out there she is around 45 years old.

[Samir Valambhia](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/samir-valambhia-21-002406) went missing on the 25th January 1999 from Harrow, London, UK. He was 25 years old, and would be [48-49 years old](https://www.mylondon.news/news/local-news/missing-people-london-who-disappeared-23468561) if he's around today. Samir had previously lived in Brent, London, UK. Note that the second link states that he'd be both 48 and 61 - this must be a typo as 23 years have passed since he went missing, and he was 25 at the time.

[Dean Martin](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/dean-martin-19-002106) was 38 when he went missing from Birmingham, UK on 6th April 2019. If Dean is still out there, he's 41-42 years old. No further information is available about Dean.

[Ailing Chen](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/ailing-chen-19-004781) was 40 when she went missing [from her home](https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/19189429.30-women-missing-south-east/) in Colchester, UK on January 17th 2017. If she's still out there, she's 45-46 years old.

[Pin Yun Lin](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/pin-yun-lin-19-001170) was last seen on [Stevenson Street](https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/17498789.pin-yun-lin-police-increasingly-concerned-missing-calton-woman/) in Glasgow, Scotland, at about 2PM on February 17th 2019. Pin was 37 at the time and is an Asian woman, about 5' tall, and slim, with black hair to her shoulders and brown eyes. Pin Yun's first language was Mandarin and she spoke little English. She was last seen wearing a blue shirt. Pin Yun has links to the Inverness area of Scotland, and so one Detective states she may have travelled to Inverness. If Pin Yun is still out there, she is 40-41 years old.

[Aisha Kabah](https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/help-us-find/aisha-kabah-19-000005) went missing on [19th November 2018](https://www.mylondon.news/news/local-news/faces-17-women-who-went-16185257) at the age of 21 from the Richmond area of London, UK. In the only photo available of her that I can find, Aisha was wearing a headscarf. If Aisha is still alive she is around 24-25 years old.

There are many, many, MANY more cases with few details out there - I wish I could do a post for every single one of them to give them the respect and attention they all deserve as individuals. I hope this post shines a little light on these people. Nastaran was just a little girl. Samir's loved ones have been missing him for 23 years.  These people are PEOPLE, and deserve attention and love. I wish we knew what makes them all happy, what makes them laugh, their hobbies, their interests, their passions. Until then, the best I can do is to talk about them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/v1o8nl/there_are_many_missing_people_with_few_details/

Finally, he yells ""FUCK!"" And pushes me away. He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it? I was really confused, while he went to the bathroom to go see what was going on. And my eyes see the opened ramen pack in the kitchen trash bin, and I realize the spice/pepper must've still been in my mouth and probably burned him.

He comes out cursing, asking me what the fuck was wrong with me. I apologized and explained I didn't realize my eating ramen could hurt him. He left, and I'm a little disappointed. But also now I'm hungry again and eating another bowl of Korean fire noodles with extra chili flakes

MORE INFO: About ""heat days"" - We used to get heat days, but the district central offices announced 2 years ago that a bunch of schools received air conditioning, so they probably think that's true. In reality, the window units provided can't be installed because the windows are designed to only slightly open, and there are metal grates outside every window.

About a dozen of schools had central air installed, and I can confirm they don't work for shit. And this is a very small percentage of schools.

They CAN still call an early dismissal, but I just imagine they would've done so by now, because what are they waiting for? They've known how hot it's going to get today for days.

Backstory:

I met my ex when we were both 10. She was (is) my twin sister's best friend so we've always been kind of a trio growing up. We started dating at 14 and got married at 23. Thing got ugly though cause 5 years after getting married, she told me she had a month long affair with her coworker. Apparently the guilt was too much for her so she confessed. We tried to work through it but after a few months of trying, I knew that despite the fact that I loved her I couldn't trust her anymore. She told me she still loved me and that she'd wait for me and prove that I was the only one. I wanted to believe her but you know... Something's just can't be fixed. We never had kids.

3 years after the divorce I met my now wife (38F) and we got married 2 years after dating. She's everything I could ever dream of in a wife and more. My ex, as my sister told me (they're still besties), never really recovered. She quit her job and is now working in a church. Throughout my relationship with my wife, she kept trying to get back together and, on the day of my wedding, she told me she still loved me and would love no one else. She said this was the last time she would bother me but that she'll wait for however long it took. Apparently she's honest in that regard at least cause my sister says she's never been with anyone since.

So here's what happened recently...

My wife and I, married for 7 years now, have two kids (7F) and (3M). My sister came over with her own kids so the cousins could play. While my wife was out to pick up lunch, my sister sat me down and told me the situation about my ex.

Apparently, she only has less than 6 months to live. She refused treatment and wants to live the last few months to the fullest. I guess that's why her and my sister really went out of their way to travel despite the pandemic. One thing on her bucket list though was that she wanted to feel like my wife again. No sex, no kissing, she just wanted me to be around the house (she still lives in the house we lived in) again and maybe hold her from time to time. I told her I wouldn't do that, cause that was pretty much emotionally cheating. My sister kept arguing and begging me to at least see her and hear her out. We kept arguing (no screaming, the kids were in the next room with her older daughter) til my wife came back. My sister told her the whole story and while she looked upset, she said she understood where my ex was coming from.

When my sister left, my wife and I talked about it. My wife knows everything that happened in the past with my ex. She says while she isn't thrilled about the idea, she won't get upset if I decided to see her on a regular basis.

My wife is literally the best thing that ever happened to me and I love her more than anyone. She makes me happier than I've ever been in my life, even in the good times with my ex. She knows I won't cheat. I also have 0 romantic feelings for my ex so there's nothing lingering there. I don't hate her or anything, it's just that the love I had for her has long since died.

After thinking about it for a while, I'm honestly 50/50 about it. I know I don't owe her anything but I feel like I might regret not seeing her at least one more time, since the last time I saw her was on my wedding day and that wasn't a good encounter for either of us (unless you count the times I occasionally see her in the store or something). I honestly feel like, despite what she did, she still deserves to go with some peace.

On the other hand, I'm not entirely sure if this might potentially affect our marriage. My wife says she's ok with it, and I believe her but I just can't be sure that she'll feel the same way after it happens. I don't want anything to jeopardize what I have right now, no matter what. I'm not to thrilled about going myself to be honest.

Any advice? What should I do?

TL/DR: Ex wife who cheated on me wants me around in the last few months of her life. Current wife is ok but I don't want to risk anything.

Edit: Just wanna add that if ever I do this, I won't be acting like a husband or anything inappropriate like that. Just gonna see her and talk for a bit. My sister says that me just being there and sharing a meal with her would be more than enough for her to feel like we were married again.

[**Update from September 9, 2020.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/iperqj/update_my_40m_ex_wife_40f_wants_me_to_be_with_her/)

Quick recap: My ex wife, who Ive known since I was 10, cheated on me but is now dying and wants me to be around before she dies.

It's been almost 3 weeks since I've posted and a lot has happened since. I got some solid advice from a lot of you guys, especially some who messaged me their personal experiences. I'd like to thank you guys from the bottom of my heart.

So here's what happened...

As many of you guys suggested, I talked to my wife. We had a long discussion about the whole situation and I assured her that no matter what, she is and always will be my first priority. I also assured her that while I wanted to say my good-bye, I would never act like her husband. It would be more like me seeing a childhood friend or something like that. I also told her I would never spend the night nor would I be alone with her.

She was more comfortable after our talk and was pretty ok with the idea of me seeing my ex again. As you guys guessed, she really felt like she was forced into being ok with it when my sister asked but this time, she really was ok.

So I talked to my sister and after a long, long heated discussion about what my ""role"" would be in the visit, she agreed to the boundaries my wife and I set.

A week later my sister and I came over to our old marital home. It was surreal cause while the emotions from years before came back to me, I didn't feel any sadness nor hatred or anything negative. I saw my ex, who was waiting for us in the living room and she cried when I walked in. Most of you suggested she was faking it but while she was still strong, you could tell almost immediately something was wrong with her. I indulged her with a hug and we talked for a few hours while my sister made lunch. I showed her pictures of my kids and told her stories about what they're like. Honestly, I didn't know how I would react after I saw her again but it just feels like seeing an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. There was no hate or anything like that.

I walked around the house and it was pretty much the way it was when I left over a decade ago. I'm not really sure how I feel about our wedding photos still framed and pictures of us still all over the house but it wasn't really my place to say anything.

The three of us had lunch and played board games all afternoon. It honestly felt like we were back to when we were kids and the three of us would hang out together. It was nice.

I left at around 6. She was sad but she understood. When I hugged her good-bye, she whispered ""I love you"" to me but then said how she's happy I was able to find the happiness she couldn't give me. That part got to me to be honest and I was fighting back tears. I told her I'd see her again soon and she asked if I could bring my kids next time. I told her I would and left to pick up dinner for my family.

I told my wife everything that happened and she was quite happy about the outcome. I guess it helped that I brought home her favorite food but she also agreed to let me bring the kids next time.

Overall, it was a great experience seeing her again. I feel like I needed that and would've regretted not doing so.

Again, I'd like to thank everyone who gave me advice. Also, please don't roast my ex too much. She made a mistake and paid the price but it doesn't mean she's an evil person.

This will be my last update. Thank you very much, reddit.

&#x200B;

First, ill be using these 4 ranks to categorize each contribution, the criteria for each rank are explained below. 

It's important to note that these are not solely based on power scaling, but rather the effect each feat had on the overall war, strength obviously plays a role but it is only a part of it.

Highest to Lowest 

\- Diamond 

\- Gold 

\- Silver

\- Bronze 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s84d2n7tns291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6f3eef625382f8a8bbfbea9f44d7f68cc2e5345

https://preview.redd.it/cf8v4izqns291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c36a3f892cd58d899cc567c8f8777b7dbd713932

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The** **Strawhats****:** 

&#x200B;

**Luffy**

\- First up is Luffy, his greatest 2 achievements during the raid are leading the Strawhats and defeating Kaido. I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that performed well in this arc, it's kinda how every arc in One Piece is. 

\- It might seem unfair to some for me to give Luffy the highest tier just for being a captain, but the truth of the matter is that the strongest force on the alliance side (The Strawhats) would have no reason of being here if Luffy didn't lead them to the raid. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sdxytufwps291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b0957ceb1dbb3f618fedca10a2af7d87735db1e

&#x200B;

**Zoro** 

\- One of the most impactful members of the alliance he has been fighting strong opponents since the begging of the raid. He was also great support on the rooftop and down on the live floor.

\- Zoro's most impactful feat in this arc would be blocking the combined attack from Big Mom and Kaido, if he wasn't present 4 of the strongest fighters would either be out of the fight to fatally injured. Basically giving the alliance a 0% chance of winning.    


https://preview.redd.it/c6cp65lhqs291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=465731f40a0f462905feec09c5230cd3880641f8

&#x200B;

**Usopp & Nami** 

\- Usopp and Nami were together throughout most of the raid, so I lumped them together. Their performance was honestly just embarrassing. Hopefully, that's amended during Elbaf.   


https://preview.redd.it/kmofe5zmqs291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ee66b9e5aadd1dcdc5ac1e3fb62f0f63700b284

&#x200B;

**Sanji**: 

\- Sanji's mostly played support this arc and other than defeating Quen there isn't much of note, not the best performance but a solid one. 

  
\- This isn't that surprising since he did have an arc centered around, so he did get kinda sidelined when it comes to overall contributions 

https://preview.redd.it/jd0vfnd7rs291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=508750c54a4ad72adcb517a4947100d4d7811ce3

&#x200B;

**Chopper**: 

\- Mainly played a support role in this arc 

\- Chopper also had a solid performance this arc, which is surprising since he really didn't defeat anyone of note.   

https://preview.redd.it/1j8yjdbirs291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=5156e922f8cb211bc05e2a697a2eb5e38a956d9f

&#x200B;

**Robin & Brook:** 

\- It seemed like Oda wanted to give Robin a more impactful contribution to the arc and that came at the cost of Brook not being as useful as he was in the previous arc. 

https://preview.redd.it/wss10eeqrs291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=8312d24067e9fc51032225e541d0e73f9865e5e2

&#x200B;

**Franky & Jinbe** 

\- Both affected the raid around the same level they defeated comparable opponents and then continued the raid providing support to different characters 

https://preview.redd.it/6d8zes26ss291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66104a2e3b8feae0d30c5f4288b792a0009bc47

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Allied Forces:** 

Next up are the different allied characters in Wano, I didn't include every character since that would take forever but I tried to focus on the important ones.

&#x200B;

Law & Kid 

\- Law & Kid, both far exceeded the expectation I had for them and without either of them, I can't see how the alliance even has a chance of winning.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n9n39iltss291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d225474159b1f1f3299ccde4ef1cdabe60e16d6

&#x200B;

Killer 

\- Killer on the other hand didn't really pull his weight this arc other than a few stand-out scenes here and there, his performance didn't measure up to the other 4 rooftop supernova. 

\- Still not a bad performance but not great by any measure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9i5x5zz1ts291.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=57c904072e1b665d05ffc2fb8332dc0d2a9fc72b

&#x200B;

**Yamato, Marco, & O-tama**

Lastly, is what I would call the support team, they didn't really have a major win against any opponents but they all made up for it by supporting the alliance in their own way 

\- Otama: gained new allies  

\- Yamato: kept Kaido stalled long enough

\- Marco: cut the enemies forces by a large percentage by removing BM's ship

It's a variant of the Enterprise edition and is the Windows 10 equivalent of Windows 7 Ultimate. 

LTSC is:

 • clean (no pre-installed non-removable junk ""apps"" and no ads), 

 • resource efficient (no cortana and other background processes) and 

 • stable (no feature updates to break your computer - just security and bug fixes for 10 years).

 

It's not actively advertised, Microsoft tries rather hard to make sure people don't use it and Windows 10 fans will barage you with marketing talking points about how awful and useless it is.

This a repost of another user from 2 years ago. Two years is plenty of time and there are always more people who would benefit from this information. [This is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/cpu0jf/ysk_that_there_is_a_version_of_windows_10_that)

Why YSK: The business practices of windows as of lately are extremely anti consumer (and many other companies too). Nobody should be forced to use a inferior product with bloatware you never asked for. This post is not advocating for piracy, because you can get a LTSC license legally although by unconventional means (such as buying a license somewhere on the internet). However not many people know about this version's existence. More power to the consumers and less to the corporations which don't really care and are eager to abuse you.

Edit: Lots of people have mentioned that LTSC is not for end users because it's meant for something specific that won't benefit from updates.. like points of sale, ATM's, medical and metrology devices, etc. All of that is true. That does NOT mean that this version would be bad for end users. One thing doesn't necessarily imply another. It all depends on what you are willing to trade. For me, personally, having less bloat and no telemetry and assistant and store is a absolute no-brainer compared to the ""upside"", which is that you might actually want to get good updates and won't be able to.. because I've been using windows 10 LTSC for 4 years now and never had the need for a specific update besides security updates (which LTSC gets). In reality, people value a machine that works and doesn't shove shit down your throat, even if you lose the promise of some big update which in most cases, isn't even worth it as windows 11 is shit and I mean it, ask anyone from IT and they'll tell you that windows 11 is a cash grab with no actual improvements. If you like the new bells and whistles and want to be on the next new big thing, then avoid this version designed to be stable with all that that implies. Just in case anyone has doubts, I use my computer for gaming too and NEVER had any compatibility issues. THAT IS THE POINT. You can game in 10 LTSC with no problems because THAT IS THE POINT. Because it's designed to be stable. It isn't a hard concept to understand. 

But if you are still in doubt, take this in mind: It's a windows version that is designed to be more stable than the consumer version. That means, by definition, that LTSC IS and WILL BE more stable. That is the reason why it exists in the first place. So most arguments against it I've read here are just fear-mongering. If anyone has any bad experiences, please share and tell your story. But don't fall for the ""uhh no, end users are dumb and they need the new extra stuff"" argument. You don't need it. That's the whole point, in fact Microsoft themselves said that 10 was the last windows version. They later changed their mind and released 11 when they realized they could make suckers pay again for a senseless upgrade which adds absolutely-fucking-nothing. Sorry if I am making the same point over and over.. it's just that there is no legitimate reason to let Microsoft fuck you over and steal your info or put fucking candy crush in your AutoCAD workstation. Your computer is YOURS and you should chose what you want and what you don't want to see/use.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/v161ys/ysk_that_there_is_a_version_of_windows_10_that/

#First, some context

If you’re unfamiliar with Harry Potter or fandom culture in general, here’s a quick primer:

- Harry Potter is the name of a YA series about wizards. You probably have some degree of familiarity with it, unless you’ve been in a coma for the past two decades. The main cast consists of the titular Harry Potter and his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Also relevant is a more minor character called Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister and Harry’s eventual partner.
- A “ship” is a romantic relationship. If you ship two characters, that means you want them to get together. When the fandom violently disagrees about which characters should get together, that’s a ship war. 

Now that that’s sorted: 

#The Background

Let me take you, dear reader, to a “simpler” time: 2005. George W. Bush was just re-elected, the Pope just died, and North Korea might have nuclear weapons, but who gives a shit about any of that? More importantly, the Harry Potter fandom is in its heyday, and it shows no signs of slowing down. The sixth installment of the series, *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,* is languishing in heavily-guarded boxes, just waiting for the release date when millions of teenagers can get their grubby little hands on it. The anticipation is building: who will live? Who will die? And, most critical of all, *who will end up with who?* See, the characters themselves are teenagers now, and that means they're old enough for actual canon relationships. Gone are the days of writing endless Percy/Penelope smut because they were the only canonical Hogwarts-aged couple you could project your romantic fantasies onto. The main characters are growing up now. And there's a real chance that a popular fan ship—maybe *your* popular fan ship!—could be canonized, either in this installment or the next.

So which ships are in the race for the title of Official Canon Couple? There were many, *many* popular Harry Potter fan ships, but a lot of them were out of the running for some reason or another—being too weird, too inappropriate for the target audience, or too not-heterosexual. It was generally agreed upon that one of the main hetero Hermione ships would take the crown—Harry/Hermione (Harmony or H/Hr), Ron/Hermione (Ronmione, Romione, Heron, or R/Hr) or Malfoy/Hermione (Dramione or D/Hr.) That last one had a fervent following, but there was no indication in the books that Malfoy or Hermione felt anything for each other besides mutual hatred, so it was probably out of the running. That left Harry/Hermione and Ron/Hermione battling for the win. 

Shippers on both sides had plenty of evidence to back up their opinions; at the time, it seemed like either ship had a decent chance of happening. On one hand, Hermione and Harry looked like the obvious choice: Harry was the main character, Hermione was the most prominent female character, and the hero always gets the girl. Plus, they were both played by hot actors in the movies, so there you go. Even beside that, though, Hermione and Harry were good friends in the books, and Hermione's relationship with Harry was generally more stable than her relationship with Ron. Their interactions were mostly platonic, but they were young, and that could change. On the other hand, Ronmione was plausible, too—Ron and Hermione had plenty of (belligerent) sexual tension, they were also good friends, and it wouldn't be that unexpected if they coupled up. And, besides, recent books introduced more prominent female characters for Harry to potentially fall for—Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and a handful of other not-outlandish possibilities. So who would wind up with who? Time would tell. In the meantime, supporters of each faction took up arms and booted up their clunky family desktops, preparing to fight the good fight: the Ship Wars.

#Before The Half-Blood Prince: The Skirmishes

A series of skirmishes took place in the early months of 2005 as anxious fans waited for the release of *The Half-Blood Prince.* In order:

**The failure of the American education system**

In January of 2005, a self-described teacher called Cat on a Harry/Hermione shippers mailing list declared that shipping Ron/Hermione was both a sign of low intelligence and a symptom of the failures of the American education system. In her words:

>One of the things we found was that most reading comprehension tests only ""test"" for certain types of understanding. Of the hundreds of types of understanding, most schools only test for 12 to 14 types of /surface/ information. Students are not asked to ""infer"" or come to their own conclusions based on context clues. They are only asked to identify /obvious/ facts. This means that most students (unless they study on their own or read a lot) don't learn how to ""read between the lines."" Can we all see where I'm going with this? Good, I thought so! SO! R/Hr shippers identify themselves with ""Isn't it Obvious?"" while most H/Hr shippers identify themselves with ""Read Between the Lines."" There are (at least on certain websites) about twice as many R/Hr shippers as H/Hr shippers. So here's my thesis: /*IF*/ H.M.S Pumpkin Pie is the ship that sails, Harry Potter may just prove that there is a large gaping hole in the American Education System.

[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20100616151430/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/601405.html)

(""The HMS Pumpkin Pie"" is yet another name for Harry/Hermione. The term comes from a *very* early fanfiction where they kiss and Hermione says that Harry tastes like pumpkin pie. It fell out of use partially because pumpkin pie isn’t common in Britain, and partially because look at me and say the words “HMS Pumpkin Pie” with a straight face, I dare you.)

Other commenters agreed, remarking on how they believed Ron/Hermione shippers to be less intelligent, less capable of literary analysis, and generally more desperate than the brilliant, bookish Harmony shippers. At least one person did attempt to argue with Cat, saying that it was just a difference in personal opinion and not necessarily a symptom of stupidity or a poor education, but if you've ever argued with a stranger on the Internet, you already know this was futile. No minds were changed, and much debate was had over the Americanization of the Harry Potter fandom, the horribleness of high school teachers, et cetera et cetera et cetera. 

**JKR's supposed anti-feminist views**

(Obligatory note that all of this drama happened over a decade and a half ago, long before the TERF stuff and Twitter antics were common knowledge, so that isn't a factor here.)

Sadly, I don't have links for this because archive.org didn't get to the threads, but the gist of it is that a well-known Harry/Hermione shipper wrote an essay declaring that Hermione was a feminist, the Weasleys are not feminists, and therefore Harry/Hermione is a feminist ship and Harry/Ginny is not. It more or less boiled down to ""Hermione is cool and smart, and Molly Weasley is a housewife with seven children, Q.E.D."" Popular fandom newsletter *The Daily Snitch* linked to the debate, which resulted in a lot of angry comments and a long, petty debate.

**The Symbolic Flight**

The whole Symbolic Flight debacle requires a bit of context, so here's a brief breakdown: at the end of book 3, Harry and Hermione briefly ride on the hippogriff, Buckbeak, while Ron is out of commission elsewhere. Harry/Hermione shippers took this flight as a symbolic confirmation of the pair's deeply held romantic feelings for one another, thus the name ""Symbolic Flight."" In one of the later books, Buckbeak was renamed Witherwings for some plot-relevant reason that I honestly don't remember, and the Harry/Hermione shippers that believed the Symbolic Flight theory took the re-naming as a forceful sinking of their ship. 

Anyway, two days before the release of *The Half-Blood Prince,* a prominent Ron/Hermione shipper posted a rather caustic essay in which she dismantled the Symbolic Flight theory. This drew plenty of irate Harry/Hermione shippers, who proceeded to duke it out in the comments section as per usual. After a metric shit ton of drama, a sequel to the essay was posted, which basically said the same thing with the same caustic and superior tone. It generated six more pages of arguing in the comments before the discourse finally died down. As one incredulous (anonymous) commenter put it:

>I'm kind of WTF-ing over the whole thing. Yeah, I once wrote an essay on the stomp as an effect in giant robot anime, but this borders on...why? None of this is canon, and the comments back even make it worse. It's like being stuck in a state senate: Nothing of importance actually happens when it's supposed to, and there's lots of meaningless talking, yelling, and baiting. (Of course, this may just be in Alabama.)

[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20130824180958/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/763985.html)

And then the book came out.

#Throwing The Book At Them: The War Begins

On July 26, 2005, *The Half-Blood Prince* was released in most of the Anglosphere. It was an extremely plot-heavy book that culminated in a major character's death, but again, who cares? More importantly, it canonized Harry/Ginny, and *strongly* implied that Ron and Hermione would end up together. Much of the book is devoted to a love triangle of sorts between Ron, Hermione, and a minor character called Lavender—basically, Ron starts dating Lavender after becoming a popular Quidditch player, which makes Hermione extremely jealous. And, just to really drive home the point that Ron and Hermione are going to be the Official Canon Ship, it's repeatedly emphasized how awful Ron and Lavender are for each other—they call each other cringeworthy nicknames, Lavender is clingy and annoying, and Ron remains interested in Hermione throughout. This deeply annoyed Harry/Hermione shippers, partially because the strong Ron/Hermione subplot effectively confirmed that Harmony wouldn't be happening, but also because the extremely irritating nature of Ron and Lavender's relationship eliminated Lavender as a possible non-Hermione love interest for Ron. It's complicated. But the gist of it is that Ronmione shippers were smug, and Harmony shippers were pissed.

For a while, the remaining Harmony shippers attempted to re-interpret the events of the book in a way that supported Harry/Hermione, characterizing Ron and Hermione's actions towards each other as immature, unhealthy, and just plain horrible. There's a scene where Hermione attacks Ron with little magical birds after he and Lavender walk into a room where she's hiding; your mileage may vary on whether this was clearly a harmless joke or the start of a horrific abusive relationship, but you know which side the more militant Harmony shippers were on. Blah blah blah, Harmonians and Ronmione shippers hate each other and start drama, you know the drill. 

**The forced Chinese abortion conspiracy theory**

About a month after the book's release, an angry fan wrote a long, conspiratorial rant about how buying Harry Potter books is basically donating your money to forced eugenics and abortions in China. It's... a lot. You can read some of it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20101124111746/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/773990.html). Readers quickly caught on to the fact that not only was the whole rant batshit, but the person who posted it suspiciously only started caring after JKR wrote Harry/Ginny, one of his disliked ships, into *The Half-Blood Prince.* The conspiracy theorist was eventually banned from most major Harry Potter fan communities, but the phrase ""forced abortions in China"" lived on. 

**Now you know how slaves feel**

Around the same time, a Harmony shipper named Panther claimed that he now understood how slaves felt after a the owner of a popular fansite called Harmony shippers ""delusional."" This exchange spawned a number of tongue-in-cheek icons, which the notorious [MsScribe](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/9miil4/fanfiction_community_bored_woman_creates_12/) later used as evidence that the Fan Wank community (a group dedicated to poking fun at silly fandom drama) was racist. 

 **The Harmony teacher**

Later that month, a member of the fanfiction website Portkey made a post in which he claimed to be a high school teacher. He said he assigned his students essays about shipping and only gave As to the Harry/Hermione essays, which were objectively better than the Ron/Hermione essays because Harry/Hermione is an objectively better ship. This went down poorly with Ron/Hermione shippers for obvious reasons.

**God loves Harmony**

That September, a user called McGonagall made a post on the HMS Harmony forums declaring that Harry/Hermione was a better ship. It started out as a very pretentious and melodramatic essay about how evil Ron/Hermione is:

>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. History is marked by the tragic consequences of man’s yielding to the sin of “hubris” – pride. JKR had better learn from the lessons of history – because her pride may very well yet be her downfall. I have said before that the HP series had the potential and the promise to be one of the most enlightening literary works of this age, and a vehicle for untold millions of the younger generation to see and understand that they have it in them to rise above the banality – and mediocrity – of the stereotypes painted by the popular media and by a global society that is increasingly focused on materialism and selfish interests. But JKR, in her insistence on sticking to her “original outline” for the series, has effectively derailed the immense promise of the HP series, and – dare I say it? – placed her own interests above the higher purpose that this series may have served. And what is the result of this monumental act of pride? The sorry mess that is HBP.

Then it devolved into a religious essay about how God would swoop in and save the Harmony ship:

>As those of you who are closest to me know, I am a Catholic. While I never thought the HP series the ""work of the devil"" as some Christians called it, I know every Harmonian knows and understands why I cannot find it in my heart to defend HBP as I defended the first five books. Nonetheless, my faith tells me that God, in His infinite love and wisdom, always has a plan for everything. This will give me the strength to hope in your hopes that Book 7 may yet be salvaged.

[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20091216071015/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/794072.html)

It spawned many icons and several comics, which are now sadly unavailable. :(

**OBHWF shippers have genetic problems**

This one also requires a bit of context. OBHWF stands for ""One Big Happy Weasley Family,"" and is the umbrella term for people who ship Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, and sometimes a handful of other Weasley-centric ships, with the name coming from the fact that everyone marries into the Weasley family and they all become in-laws and whatnot. Some people hated this idea passionately, especially people who did not like Ron or Ginny, and someone made a post basically saying as much. Sadly, only [some](https://web.archive.org/web/20130824184344/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/860630.html) of the thread is archived, but thanks to Fan Wank, we know that it eventually spawned this glorious argument:

>By the way there is something i ponder upon that why in general Herons are rude people, i mean is this some kind of genetic problem or a genetic trait ?I think there should be a proper research on herons ,who knows we might find out the reason behind their immature and illogical attitude.

(If you missed it before, Heron is another term for Ron/Hermione. Harmonians liked to use it as an insult. I don't know why.)

This, predictably, spawned a lot of incredulous comments, plus arguments about whether Ron/Hermione shippers are genetically deficient, mentally unwell, forever alone, or just generally fucked in the head. 

**Nazi comparisons**

This one is simple, but stupid. The HMS Harmony—a popular Harry/Hermione community, as you probably know by now—attempted to ""establish a dialogue"" with Ron/Hermione shippers, which led to Nazi comparisons and arguing about socialism in record time.  A lot of people took offense to the fact that Ron/Hermione shippers had nicknamed their ship ""the good ship,"" implying that Harry/Hermione was ""the bad ship"" (tons of other Hermione ships existed at this point and the theoretical ""bad ship"" label could have applied to any one of them, but go off I guess.) The political arguments started when someone implied that ""The Good Ship"" is similar to ""the Grand Old Party,"" meaning Ron/Hermione shippers were actually Republicans, and from there it just kind of deteriorated:

> Also, the labeling of oneself as ""Good"" (despite the intended origins of the word in regards to British nautical terms) reminds me of socialism, as socialist will usually spend a good deal of time trying to convice the masses (and themselves) that itself only is ""Good"" and everything else is not. Socialism doesn't lift up the masses, it only reduces everyone to an equal level of misery. This perception to me is reinforced by the R/Hr wankers and by Mugglenet in general. There you have a website that is now basically dedicated to the pursuit and attack on free thinkers who don't wish to the follow ""canon"". For some odd reason, when I think of Mugglenet, a vision of Goose-stepping soldiers come to mind.

[Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20100825094244/http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/876013.html)

This went on for a while, with people occasionally dropping in to comment things like ""The Good Ship is a nautical thing, it's just a pun about ships."" (Also, the main Harmony forum was, again, the **HMS** Harmony, making this whole thing extra stupid.) There were also multiple comments dunking on herons—as in, literal [herons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron), the birds. 

**JKR's secret communications**

In March of 2006, JKR did an interview in which she made this statement about the four houses at Hogwarts:

> If only they could achieve perfect unity, you would have an absolute unstoppable force, and I suppose it's that craving for unity and wholeness that means that they keep that quarter of the school that maybe does not encapsulate the most generous and noble qualities, in the hope, in the very Dumbledore-esque hope that they will achieve union, and they will achieve harmony. Harmony is the word.

Some militant Harry/Hermione shippers took the statement ""Harmony is the word"" to mean that Harry/Hermione was the endgame ship and *The Half-Blood Prince* was just a distraction, engineered to throw people off. This led to extensive arguing about whether JKR is attempting to drop pro-Harmony hints using wordplay and secret codes, or whether she's an evil bitch who's stringing Harry/Hermione shippers along for money (and also because she's a sadist.) 

#The Wrath of Caina

No Harmony/Ronmione shipping war writeup would be complete without Caina. Caina was a well-known shit stirrer who was involved in multiple controversies, especially during and after the *Half-Blood Prince* era. She owned and maintained hermionepotter.com, she was a prominent member of the HMS Harmony, she believed wholeheartedly in the Symbolic Flight theory, and she *hated* the idea of Ron ending up with Hermione. After the sixth book’s release, she swore she would close her fansite and leave the fandom permanently. 

Yeah, sure, Caina. If only. 

***HBP: The Harmonian Way***

Caina’s first major controversy occurred in April of 2005 when she attempted to rewrite *The Half-Blood Prince* in its entirety to support Harry/Hermione instead of Ron/Hermione. Fix-it fics like this are reasonably common, even today—you’ve probably seen or read many if you’re part of a fandom where the main ship was sunk somehow—but the issue with Caina’s story was that it was almost a direct copy of the book, with minor alterations added to make Hermione appear better and Ginny appear worse. It was composed of entire chapters of text lifted directly from the original novel, with most passages remaining totally unchanged unless they dealt directly with Ginny or Hermione, in which case the girls’ names were sometimes swapped. Basically, it *really* pushed the definition of a transformative work, putting it in questionable legal territory. This actually didn’t cause shipping drama so much as it caused legal drama; people in the comments quickly started arguing about the legality and morality of basically re-uploading a whole book with some names switched around, and some readers expressed anxiety that this kind of practice would lead to fanfiction in general being scrutinized more harshly. It’s worth noting again that this was in the mid-2000s, long before the dawn of Archive of our Own and similar projects that aimed to archive and legitimize fanfiction—fan content in general was much more questionable, and authors could, and would, attack people harshly for creating fanfiction and fanart. Though I don’t recall any major instances of JKR herself doing this, it definitely happened in other fandoms, so people had every right to be concerned that Caina’s project would attract unwanted negative attention. 

Caina initially tried to get around the criticism by declaring her story a “parody,” but this didn’t work, and she eventually took the whole document down, although she did promise to restore it eventually (in her words: ”Oh, I'll find a way. Mark my words, it may not have my name on it, but it WILL see the light of day. Someday. Legal or not.”) To the best of my knowledge, though, it was never re-uploaded, and the scandal quickly faded into the background of Caina’s other bullshit. If, for some reason, you still want to read it, you can just go to the library, rent a copy of the actual *Half-Blood Prince* book, mentally swap Ginny and Hermione’s names every time they come up, and basically get the same effect. 

**On the use of the word “retarded”** 

(Apologies for not censoring “retarded,” I can’t use asterisks or anything without messing up the Reddit formatting.) Caina’s troubles were only just beginning. She appeared again on Fan Wank when she began referring to Ron/Hermione shippers as “retards.” When someone told her to stop because it was offensive, she replied:

>I know someone who is retarded, they've been there all my life. I'm not making fun of retarded people. You, however, are making a mountain out of a molehill. I won't be lectured by you, okay? If you don't like my way of speach, get the hell off the board. You see, I'm having a particularly bad day and I'm already pissed off and it would be extremely unwise for you or anyone else to provoke me today.

Predictably, this was not received well, partially because “I have a retarded friend” is not that great of an argument, and partially because misspelling “speech” as “speach” in the middle of a rant abut your right to call other people retards is just deliciously ironic. Shippers and non-shippers alike began arguing with and criticizing Caina, and in response, she eventually came up with this gem: 

>Truly retarded people don't mind if you call them retarded because they don't understand it's an insult. Deal.

This soured Caina’s reputation considerably, and she soon found herself on the receiving end of yet more criticism from a Livejournal community called the_hms_stfu, a group dedicated to poking fun at militant Harry Potter shippers. She reported the_hms_stfu to Livejournal for harassing her and for doxxing her by using her real first name… which was Caina. Like her username. the_hms_stfu was removed anyway, but the creator recreated it on JournalFen more or less immediately. People started jokingly censoring the name “Caina” in response to the controversy, calling her C—a or “She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.” Predictably, Caina, and her friends, did not like this; they caused two additional controversies related to the_hms_stfu, first when a friend of Caina’s created a new community called the_hms_getalife to make fun of the_hms_stfu, and then when Caina posted a long, rambling essay in which she denounced the_hms_stfu a second time, plus Ron/Hermione and Ginny/Harry shippers (referred to as Herons and Chocos, respectively—I don’t know where the name Chocos comes from.)

**Caina’s sister**

Just a few months later, an user called HMS FWNLOC appeared on LiveJournal, revealed herself to be Caina’s sister, and immediately denounced both sides of the ship war, plus the_hms_stfu, again. China seemingly acknowledged HMS FWNLOC as her sister, argued with her for multiple pages, and eventually reported her to Livejournal for harassment and got the account deleted. In a fit of anger, Caina once again announced that she was leaving the fandom. This did not stick, and she was back after about eight hours—literally less than half a day.

As you’ve probably already assumed, it’s very likely that HMS FWNLOC was owned and operated by Caina, not her nebulous “sister,” and she’d been arguing with herself for attention and pity. This is certainly plausible, but I guess the world will never truly know. 

**Fake appendicitis**

The *Goblet of Fire* movie was released on November 9, 2005, and JKR did not attend the premiere because her husband came down with appendicitis and needed emergency surgery. Well, he *allegedly* had appendicitis. Caina had another theory: JKR made up the appendicitis story because she was afraid of being accosted by rightfully enraged Harmony shippers on the red carpet. Caina actually posted a poll asking readers where they believed the appendicitis was a cover story—predictably, most of the responses were along the lines of “no” and “probably not,” with some commenters expressing concern about whether this was going too far. In response, Caina declared that the poll was spammed by Ron/Hermione shippers, which skewed the results. After some more melodrama, Caina stated she was leaving fandom again—ironically, for health reasons.

Guess how long that lasted?

Actually, pretty long for Caina. She was back by February 2006, when she returned, resurrected hermionepotter.net, and immediately attracted more controversy for another long rant about JKR. 

**The bikini pics**

Caina’s eighth and final controversy occurred a few months later when she became bizarrely enraged about paparazzi pictures of JKR in a bikini and posted this rant:

>For those of you who were forever scarred by seeing Rowling in a two-piece bikini, this is for you. You know this bitch thinks she's just hot shit.... You know what I like least about Rowling? Her mouth. She looks like a stroke victim with the way the left half her mouth stays shut no matter what she's doing. Oh well...I'm sure Emerson has this picture in life-size. He jerks to it every night before he turns in, I'm sure.

(Emerson was the owner of [Mugglenet](https://www.mugglenet.com/), a fansite that still exists today. He was the one who inspired the “now I know how slaves feel” incident when he called Harmony shippers “delusional.” Caina had previously earned herself *yet more criticism* by disparagingly calling him gay and sharing pictures of him wearing women’s clothing.)

This incident earned Caina yet more ire from Fan Wank and various other Harry Potter fan groups, partly because it was just a shitty thing for anybody to post and partly because people were very unwilling to be charitable towards her at this point. Not helping was the fact that someone uncovered her age around this time, and it turned out that she wasn’t just a dumb teenager like most people assumed—she was *31 years old,* a grown-ass adult. The criticism grew and grew, the melodrama intensified, and the final straw for Caina came a few weeks later, when a troll successfully stole her password and hacked into her account. This resulted in the deletion of both hermionepotter.net and her fanfiction archive, Silverwhisps. She seems to have disappeared from the fandom afterwards, and if she’s still active, I haven’t been able to hunt her down (though not for lack of trying; googling “Caina fandom wank” just returns a lot of porn starring actresses named Caina.) 

Anyway, Caina aside, *Deathly Hallows* was released in 2007, and Ron/Hermione was officially canonized. To add insult to injury for Harry/Hermione shippers, there was even an epilogue that confirmed Ron and Hermione were still happily married 19 years after the conclusion of the series. This resulted in about as much drama as you’d expect, but regardless of the fan infighting, the damage was done: Ron/Hermione had won, and Harry/Hermione was no more—well, it still existed, but only in fanfiction and headcanons, which *just wasn’t good enough.* 

#The Aftermath: Does Any Of This Even Matter?

 Well, yes and no. Despite the repeated and constant outcry from Harry/Hermione shippers, Harmony never happened in canon. JKR did mention in a 2014 interview that she retroactively believes that Harry and Hermione may have been a better match than Ron and Hermione, which fanned the ship war flames for a while again. But a lot of people had left the fandom by then, JKR soon became controversial for non-shipping reasons, and nothing ever came of the supposed Harmony confirmation. Harmony fans saw another glimmer of hope in 2016 with the debut of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,* a play that uses time travel as a plot device; many elements of the play were very fanfiction-esque, and some hoped that Harry and Hermione would at least be together in an alternate timeline, but this didn’t happen, either. There *is* a timeline where Hermione is single and Ron is married to somebody else, but both are shown to be utterly miserable. As far as canon is concerned, the HMS Harmony is well and truly sunk, even if pieces of its debris occasionally wash ashore. 

In terms of fandom culture as a whole, though? The Ronmione vs. Harmony ship war was hugely influential. They were among the first major ship wars to be fought wholly online (yes, ship wars existed long before the Internet—Star Wars and Star Trek had the Luke vs. Han wars and the Spirk wars before Harry Potter was a gleam in JK’s eye), and they were *huge* in their heyday. As far as fandom went, they were relatively mainstream; if you were in Harry Potter fan spaces, you knew about the ship wars, even if you were only on the fringes of them. They codified several modern fanfic tropes, including the infamous [Ron the Death Eater](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater), which is the practice of turning a canonically good character into a bad person to justify breaking up their canon relationships—e.g. literally making Ron into a Death Eater so Hermione can’t be with him anymore. Writer Clare McBride even posited in a 2018 [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210118135134/http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-fall-of-fandom-etiquette-and-the-rise-of-the-ship-war) that Harmony shippers specifically had a huge role in shaping the modern fandom landscape. Their insistence that their ship wasn’t just more interesting or entertaining than the alternative, but also more morally correct; their willingness to disavow JKR completely when she refused to canonize their ship; and their general behavior towards members of the fandom that disagreed with them all set the stage for modern Twitter discourse. The Harry Potter ship wars weren’t the only major fan controversies of the mid-2000s, but they were among the biggest, the loudest, and the first in the digital age. So next time you see two fifteen-year-olds calling each other Nazis and socialists over which problematic Steven Universe ships they support, you can thank Harry Potter for that, at least partially. 

#In conclusion, and acknowledgements

So there you have it. A not-so-brief, still not at all comprehensive account of some of the earliest, stupidest Harry Potter shipping drama. Many thanks to the archived remnants of Fan Wank for detailing all of this, and to the people who made this extra funny by coming up with some of the most batshit ship names and insults I’ve ever seen. Merlin bless the good ship Ronmione/Romione/Heron/whateverthefuck, long may she sail. And, though the HMS Harmony/PumpkinPie/whateverthefuckelse capsized long ago, may her memory live on.

When this changes every month she is allowed to watch 15 minutes of whatever TV show she wants in the stroller on the way to daycare. This prevents a tantrum and she forgets she’s even wearing it. 

This morning, we have to change the device and so my child gets the phone and she is watching something about space bunnies. Cool, fine. We’re on the way and I hear someone say angrily “look, another stupid mother bringing up stupid kids.” As soon as I realize it’s directed at me and my children I do a double take and say “excuse me?”

“Back in our day, we gave kids reading and writing not screens. You’re stupid and you’re making your kids stupid.”

My husband was standing right there, but it just so happens his grasp of the language in this country is not great so he doesn’t fully understand what’s happening AND we’re late. I tell him to get the kids to daycare without me. So no shame, I really let the guy have it. I reminded him most of HIS generation would beat their kids (he let me know that was normal discipline to avoid the laziness of today!) and that my children speak 4 languages. 

And this idiot has the audacity to tell me that my husband “shouldn’t let you speak this way to a man”. Whatever, man. I just ran after my husband and got to daycare. And my kid wore her device all day. Fuuuuck that person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/v1mh4t/youre_a_stupid_mother_and_youre_bringing_up/

We're Cole and Kyle and we've had the pleasure of working together for the past several years here at Leder Games. You probably know us best for our work on Root, Oath, and the upcoming game Arcs ([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074786394/arcs](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2074786394/arcs)).

We are happy to answer any questions about our current projects, what it's like to work in the games industry, or anything else. This is an AMA after all!

We will start answering questions around 10am central US time.

I met a 30yo guy who told me Japan was unique  because it had 4 seasons, and it had cherry blossoms.

I explained that a bunch of other countries also have 4 seasons and cherry blossoms.

I had to explain what latitude and longitude are, so his next question was whether all of these countries with 4 seasons were in the same timezone as Japan.

So I explained a bit about Earth.

All kinds of fish, prepared in all kinds of ways: stew, curry, salted, sweet and sour, stir fried, dumplings, etc. I also ate plenty of prawns, freshly caught octopus, crabs, and other shellfish. 

Then when I was 8 years old, while eating a fish curry (I still remember where I was sitting, what colour the plate was, and every little detail), a relatively big bone pierced my tongue through and through. I had to pull it out and was quite literally traumatized. 

Since then, no matter how much I try, and believe me I do, I HATE seafood. I absolutely hate it. The only two things I can eat for some reason are: salted fish cooked in a sort of tomato chutney but only when its served with lentils and rice (I hate salted fish fried rice) and crispy squid tentacles. When I try to taste fish or prawns, I just find them completely tasteless or something I would normally find nauseating.

Has something like that ever happened to you? And how do I ""fix"" that?


Edit: also I can't place it but I think thats the time I developed a phobia of injections. Though I'm fine with tattoos.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/v1mxub/what_food_can_you_no_longer_eat_but_used_to_love/
