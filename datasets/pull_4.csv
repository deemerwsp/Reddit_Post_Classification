My vacation for January 2023 was denied. *For my own wedding*


I just need to vent on how fucking bullshit this is.


I asked for 3 days off knowing I was being more than reasonable with this early as fuck notice. I was hoping our short staffing issues would be resolved in the next 8 months and I could take a leave from my full time line that is riddled with picking up extra shifts.


Nope. Management isn't confident that there will be a single RN available to cover these days.


I can't leave work for one of the most important events of my life because of the state of our healthcare system and nursing shortages.

Next post came a week later


[UPDATE] My vacation for January 2023 was denied. *For my own wedding*

I quit.


And it feels so good!!


I applied for a job fueled with rage and all of your support that very same day.


After the weekend and stat holiday, the manager of that job called to hire me as soon as I can start. I put my 2 weeks notice in and called my fianc√©. He is beyond happy for me and excited for all the perks this new position brings.


My new manager is going to honour all of the summer weekends I traded to have off and also my January wedding. My commute just decreased from 116 kms to 26 kms (I was chasing my passion, not what was convenient) and now I won't have to choose between showering or eating when I get home. Not only that, but my new manager operates several NP-led clinics in our area and is very much looking forward to employing me once I'm finished my NP-masters in 2024.


I would just like to say thank you to everyone who commented. There was not a single negative or accusatory remark about my situation. Your support fueled me to take charge of my career and get out of that toxic work environment. I am worth more than being enslaved by that facility. I'm worth more than exhausting myself to facilitate positive, administrative change to be brushed aside and walked on. I've found a new position that very much values my skillset, expertise, and education and I couldn't be more optimistic


Thank you, you beautiful beautiful bastards ‚ù§Ô∏è

For my PLT, we are supposed to have our webcameras on majority of the time. However, my daughter is still breast fed and the reason for me undertaking the PLT online is to care for her.

During one session she was a bit sick and her feeding schedule was off, and I let the lecturer that day know. So, when I turned my camera off, everything should‚Äôve been fine, right?

Apparently not because the lecturer called me out in the middle of class and I reminded them of my earlier email. He said that while he agreed to me feeding my daughter, I needed to be in front of the camera with it turned on so that he knew I was paying attention. I turned on my mic and said ‚ÄúI am currently breast feeding my daughter, but if you insist you‚Äôve gotta be prepared for it‚Äù he said he did. I turned it on and he went beet red and his mouth flapped like a fish and said ‚Äúokay turn your camera off til you‚Äôre done‚Äù.

He didn‚Äôt comment again if I turned my camera off :)

Edit:

Hey guys, wow this blew up way more than I expected. I just thought it was a bit of a funny story and my fianc√© told me I should post about it. Thanks for the award! 

To address some recurring comments:
- Discrimination or not, it isn‚Äôt worth pursuing legally
- as I am not in the US, it is not the subject of a title IX claim
- he was one of 5 guest lecturers for my course, and even if he was an actual employee I‚Äôd have no interest in ruining his career.
- as some have pointed out, he likely assumed it was a lie and when his assumption was proven wrong he was embarrassed 
- I wasn‚Äôt flashing the class, I simply angled the camera to where all you could see was the top of bubs head and my face. 
- again, I ASKED PERMISSION TO HAVE THE CAMERA OFF PRIOR TO CLASS SO IT WASN‚ÄôT BREAKING THE RULES",https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/v196pw/sure_ill_turn_my_webcam_on/

It's a variant of the Enterprise edition and is the Windows 10 equivalent of Windows 7 Ultimate. 

LTSC is:

 ‚Ä¢ clean (no pre-installed non-removable junk ""apps"" and no ads), 

 ‚Ä¢ resource efficient (no cortana and other background processes) and 

 ‚Ä¢ stable (no feature updates to break your computer - just security and bug fixes for 10 years).

¬†

It's not actively advertised, Microsoft tries rather hard to make sure people don't use it and Windows 10 fans will barage you with marketing talking points about how awful and useless it is.

This a repost of another user from 2 years ago. Two years is plenty of time and there are always more people who would benefit from this information. [This is the original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/cpu0jf/ysk_that_there_is_a_version_of_windows_10_that)

Why YSK: The business practices of windows as of lately are extremely anti consumer (and many other companies too). Nobody should be forced to use a inferior product with bloatware you never asked for. This post is not advocating for piracy, because you can get a LTSC license legally although by unconventional means (such as buying a license somewhere on the internet). However not many people know about this version's existence. More power to the consumers and less to the corporations which don't really care and are eager to abuse you.

Edit: Lots of people have mentioned that LTSC is not for end users because it's meant for something specific that won't benefit from updates.. like points of sale, ATM's, medical and metrology devices, etc. All of that is true. That does NOT mean that this version would be bad for end users. One thing doesn't necessarily imply another. It all depends on what you are willing to trade. For me, personally, having less bloat and no telemetry and assistant and store is a absolute no-brainer compared to the ""upside"", which is that you might actually want to get good updates and won't be able to.. because I've been using windows 10 LTSC for 4 years now and never had the need for a specific update besides security updates (which LTSC gets). In reality, people value a machine that works and doesn't shove shit down your throat, even if you lose the promise of some big update which in most cases, isn't even worth it as windows 11 is shit and I mean it, ask anyone from IT and they'll tell you that windows 11 is a cash grab with no actual improvements. If you like the new bells and whistles and want to be on the next new big thing, then avoid this version designed to be stable with all that that implies. Just in case anyone has doubts, I use my computer for gaming too and NEVER had any compatibility issues. THAT IS THE POINT. You can game in 10 LTSC with no problems because THAT IS THE POINT. Because it's designed to be stable. It isn't a hard concept to understand. 

But if you are still in doubt, take this in mind: It's a windows version that is designed to be more stable than the consumer version. That means, by definition, that LTSC IS and WILL BE more stable. That is the reason why it exists in the first place. So most arguments against it I've read here are just fear-mongering. If anyone has any bad experiences, please share and tell your story. But don't fall for the ""uhh no, end users are dumb and they need the new extra stuff"" argument. You don't need it. That's the whole point, in fact Microsoft themselves said that 10 was the last windows version. They later changed their mind and released 11 when they realized they could make suckers pay again for a senseless upgrade which adds absolutely-fucking-nothing. Sorry if I am making the same point over and over.. it's just that there is no legitimate reason to let Microsoft fuck you over and steal your info or put fucking candy crush in your AutoCAD workstation. Your computer is YOURS and you should chose what you want and what you don't want to see/use.",https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/v161ys/ysk_that_there_is_a_version_of_windows_10_that/

I‚Äôm not a fan of swim shorts with supportive mesh inside but my wife bought them for me and they look nice so that‚Äôs what I wore. 

We took a tour in a rigid hull inflatable boat out to another island and spent the morning snorkeling. Myself and some other people on the trip ended up riding on the side of the boat, bouncing on the inflatable tube as the boat bounced over the waves. 

At some point during the ride back to Maui my penis started burning. Like‚Ä¶really, really burning. The burning and stinging kept getting worse but there was no way to check on the situation since there was nowhere private on the boat, so I just endured the pain while wondering if I‚Äôd somehow gotten a jellyfish in my shorts. 

Once we docked in Maui I ran to a honey bucket to find out what the heck was going on with my dong. To my horror I discovered that salt crystals had been left behind on the mesh after my shorts dried. All the bouncing up and down on the side of the boat had effectively sandpapered little Tony raw while literally rubbing salt into my wounds at the same time. My wang is now covered in painful raw spots and scabs.

TL;DR Salt crystals dried on the supportive mesh of my swim shorts and the action of bouncing on the side of the snorkeling boat as we bounced over the waves sandpapered my penis raw",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v17xyu/tifu_by_wearing_swim_shorts_with_supportive_mesh/

The person you really need to introduce yourself to at a party is the host. You can play with the pets, wander the yard, talk to only people you know but before you leave always thank the host. Most likely the host is more anxious than you but they WILL REMEMBER you thanking them and appreciate it greatly and they will consider inviting you again.

There's an elderly Chinese lady whose often there doing tai chai. She sometimes uses a collapsible ornamental sword while doing it.

Today, some shitty person apparently had a problem with her being there and called the cops on her. So three officers came to deal with the threat she posed. The officers were unreasonably aggressive‚Äîrepeatedly threatening to arrest her if she didn't comply with their instructions. The problem is: she clearly doesn't speak English. I told them she probably spoke either Cantonese or Mandarin so they should get a translator. 

They eventually did get someone on the phone to talk to her. But the entire time, she kept motioning that if they gave her her sword back she would leave. I could easily tell that's what she was trying to communicate but the cops apparently couldn't. The officer dealing with her was mostly interested in keeping her at arms length while aggressively telling her ""I'm at my limit! You're going to be arrested.""

Anyway, they got an officer on the phone to explain to her that she was doing something wrong and kicked her out of the park. It was such a ridiculous thing to witness. And she probably won't come back to the park. Which is just sad. We need more seniors (and other folks) doing tai chi in our parks, not less. 

I caught up with her after she left the park and tried to apologize for the whole incident. She seemed to understand and said thank you. 

Dundonald Park, and Centretown more broadly, definitely has plenty of people who can pose a danger to public wellbeing. Elderly ladies doing tai chi don't fit that description. I know they have a stressful job, but the police need to do better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/v12pv8/ottawa_police_just_kicked_an_old_lady_out_of/

Based on the conversations in this forum it seems like this is news for many people. Let's look at this timeline:

* [September 2021](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/09/22/evander-kanes-wife-anna-alleges-physical-sexual-abuse-in-reported-filing-for-restraining-order/) Anna Kane accuses Kane of domestic violence and sexual assault
* [November 2021](https://www.fearthefin.com/2021/10/29/22752159/san-jose-shark-news-evander-kane-assault-case-asks-to-lift-stay) Rachel Kuechle doubles down on the sexual assault allegations against Evander Kane.
* [January 2022](https://theathletic.com/3087172/2022/01/24/trustee-in-evander-kane-bankruptcy-seeks-to-stop-funding-ex-nhl-stars-defamation-claim/), the trustee in Evander Kane's countersuit against Kuechle seeks the courts permission to stop funding the case.

So let's stop here. In 5 months, you have two sexual assault allegations and a trustee refusing to fund any type of countersuit that Kane wants to make. Let's pick it up again as things start going Kane's way.

* [December 2021](https://nypost.com/2021/12/02/evander-kane-gets-sole-custody-of-daughter-with-ex-wife-anna/) Kane wins temporary custody over his and Anna's daughter, public opinion begins to turn against Anna Kane as she's ordered to have a psychiatric evaluation.
* [January 2022](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/holland-confirms-talks-kanes-agent-affirms-belief-second-chances/) the Oilers sign Kane.
* [April 2022](https://www.sportsnet.ca/nhl/article/evander-kanes-lawyer-says-player-has-settled-lawsuit-with-buffalo-woman/), the sexual assault case by Rachel Kuechle is settled out of court.

And you can ask, what about his side of the story? He was accused of raping a woman in his hotel room and this is what his countersuit actually said: Kuechle *‚Äúfailed to take reasonable precautions for her own safety and otherwise failed to take reasonable actions to mitigate or minimize her alleged damages.""*  No  wonder his bankruptcy trustee refused to fund this.

I'm very curious how the playoff's leading goal scorer gets directly named in two sexual assault cases in the court system in the past year and very few seem to know about it. I'm guessing it's because there was so much other stuff going on with him, but IMO these two cases are the most important and should be a major topic of discussion.  I'm also curious to know who settled the case with Kuechle out of court. Someone put up over a million dollars to make that go away and all I know is it wasn't Kane.

Edit: Lots of people genuinely didn't seem to know:

No, I should not be expected to take a bullet for your kid, nor am I willing to kill what usually ends up being another student in the event of a school shooting scenario.This does not make me a bad teacher, nor does it mean I'm a crappy, selfish human being.

2. I did not sign up for what you're proposing. I have my own family and my own child to come home to, and yes, I definitely love them more than your student.

3. You seem unaware of the constant time and training RESPONSIBLE and EFFECTIVE law enforcement officers put in to make sure their skills are up to par and they will hit what they're trying to hit instead of an innocent when/if the time comes. I already work 10+ unpaid off-hours per week for my students; I'm not about to be saddled with yet another responsibility.

4. If I shoot and miss, I'm liable. If a shooting happens and I don't react by using my gun against the assailant, I'm liable. I'm not protected from liability for failure to act like police are. I will be blamed for whatever ends up happening because I didn't ""do my duty."" 

5. The political party the majority of you seem to support doesn't even trust me to assign appropriate books to your student or teach the inconvenient truths of history to your student. But you have the audacity to trust me with a firearm around them?

""Arm the teachers"" is a way for lawmakers and ammo-sexuals to pass the buck. We will not become your scapegoats for yet another issue.

The Pastor‚Äôs family on the other side of her do most of the outdoors work for her, like taking the trash to curb, raking leaves, and for the purposes of this story, mowing her lawn. 

Today, as I was mowing and cleaning up my own yard, I noticed that there were patches of tall grass and weeds that had been missed in her‚Äôs. Well, apparently she did too, because she stormed out and started cursing and, not quite yelling, but talking loud enough that I was able to hear her over my mower. 

Knowing the answer, but being a consummate pot-stirrer, I asked if she actually paid someone to do such a terrible job on her lawn. To my ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù she just glared at me and walked back into her house‚Ä¶oh well, it‚Äôs not like I was going to offer to fix it for free.

This was obviously an effect of the revolutionary war, which was fought mostly by volunteer armies. It makes sense all those people kept using guns after the war, and that they taught their children to use guns

However none of those old relatives owns a gun today, and neither does anyone else I know. To buy a gun you have to go to the one gun store in the country, which is owned by the army, and you have to pass all their tests which I'm told are quite strict, and even then they'll only sell you a revolver or a hunting rifle

Clearly Mexico went through a very radical change in gun culture, but no one can tell me when it happened nor how

I've asked my grandparents when and why did people stop buying guns, or when did people start selling them, and they are not sure. I've asked them when did the law change to make gun ownership more regulated, but again they don't know

I'm baffled. How did Mexico change so much in regards to gun ownership?

edit: About the drug cartels

I have received a few DMs from people saying that there are still tons of guns in Mexico and the drug cartels have them, but that's kinda the point. Guns went from being something everyday people would have to something only criminals have. There is no ""gun culture"" in mexico except among the people close to the drug cartels

Also, there is no doubt the drug cartels get the vast majority of their guns form the United States. Mexico is at fault for the existence of the drug cartels, but without the United States they wouldn't have as many guns as they have today",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/v14mc5/how_did_mexico_go_form_a_heavily_armed_country_to/

He comes over and we get all excited. He loves oral, so I start sucking, and he's moaning, so I'm thinking he's into it, right? Well, his moaning gets louder and he starts pushing on my head, so I assume that means keep going, and go harder. So I do that.

Finally, he yells ""FUCK!"" And pushes me away. He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it? I was really confused, while he went to the bathroom to go see what was going on. And my eyes see the opened ramen pack in the kitchen trash bin, and I realize the spice/pepper must've still been in my mouth and probably burned him.

He comes out cursing, asking me what the fuck was wrong with me. I apologized and explained I didn't realize my eating ramen could hurt him. He left, and I'm a little disappointed. But also now I'm hungry again and eating another bowl of Korean fire noodles with extra chili flakes

The survey, conducted by Deloitte between November 2021 and January 2022, included responses from more than 14,000 Gen Z members (defined as those born between 1995 and 2003) and 8,400 millennials (born between 1983 and 1994).

I just never really understood why it‚Äôs such a problem to people, I love animals so I‚Äôm somewhat biased, but it just seems like people making mountains out of molehills.

Edit: I don‚Äôt think the hygiene argument is very compelling for a few reasons:
1. Humans handle way more produce than dogs do and don‚Äôt wash their hands nearly as often or as well as they should.
2. Wash. Your. Produce. 
3. There are plenty of wild mice and birds that get into the store during shipping that live and feed and shit and piss all over the storage area in grocery stores. I very much doubt it all gets cleaned up every time. 

  That said, there‚Äôs a pretty strong argument between letting dozens of dogs in a store at once and people with phobias and/or allergies. I appreciate the enthusiasm people seem to have for the topic!",https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/v11c4p/i_like_seeing_pets_in_grocery_stores/

To the east is a street, as I'm on a corner lot, and to the west is my neighbors driveway.  I have a line of Texas Heather running down my property line, as my property actually stops about a foot before you get to the edge of my neighbors driveway.

&#x200B;

Well, because I do have SOME grass on the other side of my hedge, and I have to mow that anyway, I also go ahead and mow all the way up to my neighbors driveway.  All they have to do is edge their drive with a string trimmer and blow the grass off the concrete.  They almost never mow anyway, and their yard is 90% weeds, so its not like they care.

&#x200B;

Cut to (haha pun) last month.  I do my mowing thang, and over comes the neighbor.

&#x200B;

""So, when you mow your yard, you don't finish the edge on my driveway like you do all your edges, and you also leave grass all over my drive.  I think you should just go ahead and be an adult and finish it. And you should cut it lower anyway, so it doesn't get so tall so fast""

&#x200B;

I let him know that it's not even my grass and I don't HAVE to do anything other than mow my own lawn, everything else is a courtesy to him.  Including when I clear the leaves out of his yard in the fall because they technically came from my tree.   Also, I cut the grass high because it's hot here, and it helps to keep the moisture level higher in the soil which is better for the grass.

&#x200B;

 He's not budging.  I'm the jerk because I don't finish his yard like he thinks I should.  Fine.  

&#x200B;

Don't like how I mow your grass?  I'll stop.

&#x200B;

Cut to this morning, when I'm out mowing my lawn and Neighbor comes over to show me his citation from code enforcement.

&#x200B;

""Well, because you decided to be petty and stop mowing the grass that you should mow because it's right there, I just got a ticket for high weeds.  Thanks a lot!""  


""Bud, if you think it's my problem then call 311 and have them come out and reissue the citation to whomever owns the land that the weeds are on.  I think you'll find that the property line follows the fence (Point at line) which makes everything 12 inches to the east of your driveway your problem.  You didn't like how I was doing it, so I stopped.  So pay your ticket and mow your lawn.  Or get another ticket.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/v1ap31/dont_like_how_i_mow_your_yard_okay_ill_stop/

I took a customer's to-go order over the phone and he said that he wanted his whole meal to be ""fully vegan."" Since we were slammed, I just wrote ""FULLY VEGAN"" in capital letters. I  wasn't able to go to the BOH and make it clear he wanted it full vegan because of handling tables and bussing and other things. 

So I'm driving home from my shift and I get a text from my manager, who's pissed that I upset the customer because his order had eggs in it and they have to comp him for his meal. She sent me a picture of the ticket and said that I never indicated that he didn't want eggs.

But.... I wrote ""FULLY VEGAN"" on the ticket. Which I told her that. ""Vegan means no eggs at all.""

She retorted ""Yeah no, some vegan people want eggs in their food, which is weird but ok.""

Then again, I don't know her, or you guys, or anything else about their relationship. But I think it would be equally inappropriate for an engaged woman to go out to clubs and get felt up by other men, hit on, given lap dances, etc, regardless of it being her birthday, which is no doubt what Kevin and his friends were probably going to be doing.. Men are just as territorial and probably wouldn't be okay with that behavior from their significant other. But when a woman disallows it, she's crazy and abusive. I would not want to be disrespected by my man getting wasted with some strangers with their tits up against him, and he wouldn't want me out getting trashed with some guy rubbing his crotch on my ass on the dancefloor. I respect him enough to not put myself in that situation. I'm all for a birthday getaway with friends but if you're specifically excluding the fianc√©e for reasons, you're doing it wrong. They probably will get divorced though so no worries.""*

I propose to him that I bring my family on this undisclosed trip or that we do a day trip. OP says no.  
>  
>So day one I was already not going on this trip. So months later (it is now April) they still haven't told me anything about the trip. I find out that they are going to Montreal when I see the first picture on facebook.  
>  
>The entire trip was planned to bring cardboard Kevin. I was not included in the planning process at all. Additionally, I don't have a passport and they never told me I would need one. For those not aware, you need a passport to go to Canada. So even if I wanted to go I would have been unable to.  
>  
>Basically OP and and my amazing friends planned this the whole time as a big prank. And then as icing on the shit-cake they made me for my birthday, they decided to publicly shame my fiance in front of millions of strangers.  
>  
>OP is a fantastic friend to have. You guys are welcome to be best buds with him because I personally am done.  
>  
>This is the product of the big surprise my friends cooked up for me for my birthday. Thanks guys, you are the best friends someone could ever ask for.

# Conclusion:

A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/4enyq2/the_people_of_reddit_vs_uatemywheaties_for/) is made on r/KarmaCourt about the situation. OOP himself shows up with a few final words to say:

>People are going to believe what they will. I know a little more than you might know about the situation. I will be the bad guy for you, if that is what you need.

""[*So*](https://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/4enyq2/comment/d22u7s5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) *you're saying that the dude is lying?*

*You seem to be playing the part of a martyr while the dude you were talking about is saying that you're full of shit. Your comment seems like a pathetic attempt to save face.""*

>Believe me, I don't need ""Karma"" on a website called reddit.  
>  
>When was the last time I posted? A fantasy football thread? I have no Idea what gold is, all I know is I have some... Take it, I don't care. Take the Karma too... whatever that means...  
>  
>I've seen the internet will believe what they want and I'm okay with that. If giving your friend shit for his SO saying he can't go out with his buddies is wrong, I don't want to be right.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/v18d20/oop_claims_his_friends_crazy_fiance_wouldnt_let/

We asked for it in Halo 5 and it never came in its six years of playtime. We're asking for it now for Halo: Infinite. 

343i loves the idea of being rapidly placed in games,  going into the next game as quickly as possible. The idea of ""waiting"" in a lobby before/after a game is seemingly antiquated to them that I fear we're  never going to get a ""social Halo"" ever again.

Halo 5 and Halo: Infinite are so extremely anti-social, it's sad.

There's no more interacting with players before or after a game. There's no more viewing Spartans and their armors. 

There's no more viewing someone's service record, seeing their K/D, games played, or even if they completed the campaign on the highest difficulty.  

There's no more viewing each player's file share before a game starts to pass the time. No more finding hilarious screenshots or a random player's forge map/gametype that has three downloads. You downloaded it anyway because you want to see everyone's attempt at a map, and damn it, sometimes you genuinely find a gem of a map by randomly downloading it. 

This will never happen again. I promise you that as long as the exec/team lead making the decision to omit the pre- and post-game lobby is still in charge and getting a paycheck, they will continue to make that decision for all of us. For all of the employees and contractors under them pushing for it. 

Their decision is final, even if it's one person or a table of team leads. They make that decision and as of right now, and even during Halo 5, that decision is ""No.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/v125qb/were_never_getting_a_pre_or_postgame_lobby_again/

Hopefully it can help you! I'm always adding new guides so if you can think of anything or have any general feedback let me know!

Otherwise i hope it can be a handy tool for you!

EDIT: Wow thank you everyone! I have tried to reply to all of you as you have all been very kind and have great suggestions! I have a big to-do list for today and will be adding a lot! please keep the ideas coming and PM me if you have any guides you want me to include :)

This is my first website ever made and i'm so glad to see it be of use!

&#x200B;

I made a subreddit over at r/leafguides so follow that!

**Khoi Dang Vu** was a deaf American man who went missing from his family‚Äôs home in 2007 in Vancouver, Washington. He left on a rainy night without his coat, bike, or any belongings. His case is now considered a homicide and no trace of him has ever been found. True Crime Bullsh\*t, an investigative podcast, has surmised that Vu may be a victim of serial killer Israel Keyes. The FBI considers the case a kidnapping. Khoi is of Vietnamese descent.

Gary Ridgway aka the Green River Killer terrorized the Pacific Northwest for decades. What many people do not know is that the Green River task force is still in operation.

Two of Gary Ridgway‚Äôs known victims were of Asian American or Pacific Islander backgrounds. **Marie Malvar**, who was of Filipino descent, and **Kimi Kai Pitsor** who was native Hawaiian, but there may be more.

**Edward Ryon Makuahanai Aikau,** usually known as Eddie Aikau, a famous lifeguard and surfer, was credited with saving over 500 people at Waimea bay on Oahu‚Äôs north shore during his tenure as lifeguard. In fact not one person was reported drowned during Eddie‚Äôs shifts at the beach. In 1978, 31 year old Aikau had decided to join the Polynesia Voyaging society, a group who planned to travel from Hawaii to Tahiti using only outrigger canoes. Shortly into their journey one canoe sprung a leak and eventually capsized 12 miles south of Molokai. Eddie paddled on his surfboard towards Lanai in a valiant effort to summon help, but soon disappeared. The US Coast Guard were able to save all the passengers and a huge search was launched but Eddie was never found and is presumed drowned. Eddie Aikau is a household name in Hawaii and in the surfing community. Competitions bearing his name and t-shirts, bumper stickers, and other items inscribed with ‚ÄúEddie would go‚Äù are a constant reminder of his legacy and memory. Eddie was of Native Hawaiian and Caucasian descent. His story can be found here. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie\_Aikau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Aikau)

In September of 2019, Tampa native **Paulino Norberto Del Mundo Japor Jr.** decided she wanted to go on a 10 vacation to Cozumel, Mexico but during a layover in Dallas she called her sister and asked for help getting a ticket back to Florida as she had changed her mind about going to Mexico. Her family said on the phone she sounded ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù and ‚Äúincoherent.‚Äù She never boarded a flight home or boarded her plane to Mexico. Her last known whereabouts were documented on security tapes from the Dallas airport.  Her phone and bank account have not been used since that day and she was never seen again. Paulino is a transgender woman who went by the names Paula, Paulina, or Pauline. Although Paula had lived as  a woman for years she had not medically transitioned and it appears she still used Paulino Norberto as her legal first and middle name. She is of Filipino descent and her family is still hoping for answers.

Yuan went missing only a few weeks later while on the way to a doctor's appointment.

**Faloma Luhk**, 10, and **Maleina Luhk**, 9, disappeared while waiting for their school bus in As Teo, Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands, on May 25th, 2011. The girls were last seen sitting on a concrete slab at 6:10 a.m. across the road from their bus stop, only 300 feet from the home they shared with their grandparents. The bus arrived and left without them at 6:30 am but the girls were not reported missing until they didn‚Äôt come home after school that day. The 12 mile long island of Saipan was searched thoroughly by friends, family, locals, and the FBI but no trace of the girls or their things were ever found and their disappearance remains one of the most well known mysteries from the Northern Mariana Islands. Both girls are described as Pacific Islander females with brown hair and brown eyes. In 2011, Faloma had bronze colored highlights in her bangs, and Maleina had a large birthmark on her left cheek. She is reported as small and short for her age.

**Dong Chull Jung** disappeared within minutes in Lakewood, Washington. The 78 year old was residing at the Golden Lion Motel on Tacoma Way in Lakewood, Washington. The establishment has long been a hotbed of criminal activity and violence since at least the 1990s. On average the police responded to incidents at the 24-room hotel over 100 times per year. November 22nd 2003 was one of those times. On that day witnesses called the police after hearing a ‚Äúdisturbance‚Äù in Dong‚Äôs room. When the authorities arrived, they found a giant pool of blood on the floor as well as Dong‚Äôs prescription eyeglasses, but Dong was nowhere to be found. According to the News Tribune, a paper out of Tacoma, one week before Dong‚Äôs disappearance he was granted a temporary domestic violence protection order from a Paul C. Jung, who might be Dong‚Äôs adult son. In June of 2003, someone named Hae Sung Jung, got a restraining order against Dong. Hae might be the estranged wife of Dong, but this isn‚Äôt known for sure. There are vague reports that Dong was having ‚Äúmarital issues'' at the time of his disappearance. Very little information is available in the case. The Golden Lion Inn was finally torn down in 2017 but the fate of the elderly man who resided within remains a mystery. Dong is described as an Asian (Korean) male, with brown eyes and thinning gray hair. He is 5‚Äô6'' and weighs 135 lbs. Dong wears prescription eyeglasses but they were left behind when he vanished. If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Dong Jung please call Pierce County Crime Stoppers 253-591-5959.

(To Polt) It seems that the blue side is advantageous for the draft. What do you think? How was the draft in game 5?

Polt: The team that could choose sides all chose the blue side and won. I believe that the blue side is advantageous. We tried to prepare as much as we can from the red side, but we weren‚Äôt able to win the match.

(To Polt) How would you rate your players today? Why do you think you lost to RNG?

Polt: I can‚Äôt really put a number on the players‚Äô and coaches‚Äô performance today. All I can say is that everyone did so well. **The reason we lost was as I just said ‚Äî because we weren‚Äôt able to play on the blue side three times.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/v103pz/t1_head_coach_polt_blames_loss_on_side_selection/

#Philadelphia

Former Philadelphia police officer Edsaul Mendoza was [charged](https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2022/05/03/philadelphia-police-edsaul-mendoza-thomas-siderio-deadly-officer-involved-shooting-charges/) with murder earlier this month for shooting an unarmed 12-year-old boy in the back.

Three plain clothes officers were driving around in an unmarked police car on the evening of March 1, 2022. They witnessed 12-year-old Thomas ‚ÄúTJ‚Äù Siderio riding his bike with a friend, an unidentified 17-year-old who they recognized as ‚Äútangentially connected to a stolen firearm investigation involving a third person‚Äù. Upon initiating a stop and turning on the emergency lights for the undercover car, a gunshot went off and broke the back passenger-side window. 

The boys ran and the cops chased. Officer Mendoza fired at Siderio twice, missing both times. Siderio discarded his gun, stopped running, and either fell or dove to the ground. ‚ÄúMendoza then fired his third shot from less than ten feet away from the child, and fatally wounded him,‚Äù according to a grand jury [presentment](https://phillyda.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GJ-PRESENTMENT-MENDOZA.pdf?utm_source=Main+Media+List&utm_campaign=2e53e84340-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_07_22_01_40_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_3be4269e47-2e53e84340-19100917).

The subsequent investigation revealed that Mendoza was aware that Siderio was unarmed when he fired the fatal shot. Furthermore, the officers acted in contravention of Philadelphia Police Department Directives not to initiate a stop as plainclothes officers and engaged in a tactically unsound pursuit.

>PO Mendoza does not take cover during his approach, which would have been the tactically correct decision if he believed Thomas Siderio remained armed. Instead, he chooses to follow the ‚Äúexact opposite‚Äù tactical strategy that would be expected if he thought there was ‚Äúany possibility‚Äù that Thomas Siderio remained armed‚Ä¶Instead of taking cover or approaching cautiously, PO Mendoza runs onto the sidewalk without slowing or reassessing, finds Thomas Siderio unarmed and not fleeing, and fires one shot into Thomas Siderio‚Äôs back from within ten feet.

As is so often the case, the officers gave conflicting reports of events and lied in an attempt to avoid responsibility.

>Sgt. Butler, the supervisor for the CIU Officers, offered a similar explanation for the stop, stating that they were making the stop ‚Äú[because they recognized one of the individuals as being involved in the investigation, meaning [the 17-year-old].‚Äù

>In contrast, PO Camacho and PO Cucinelli, both of whom testified on the same day ‚Äî March 18, 2022 ‚Äî and after PO Sarpong and Sgt. Butler, for the first time stated that they intended to stop the boys for a traffic violation, i.e., riding their bicycles the wrong way on 18th Street, in addition to the firearms investigation‚Ä¶PO Camacho, after asserting that issuing a motor vehicle violation ticket was part of the reason for their stop, later acknowledged that he did not give anyone a ticket during this entire encounter and ‚Äúwe never ‚Äî I don‚Äôt give tickets for the most part.‚Äù...

>Although PO Mendoza told Sgt. Butler that he fired twice from the street near the location of the gun, this statement is not true. PO Mendoza‚Äôs actual third and fatal shot occurred much closer to Thomas Siderio, while PO Mendoza was standing on the sidewalk, mere feet away, with an unobstructed view of the no-longer-fleeing and unarmed boy.

#Chicago

The City of Chicago is facing a federal [lawsuit](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22039701/13-year-old-shot-lawsuit.pdf) after one of its officers shot an unarmed Black 13-year-old in the back, potentially paralyzing him for life.

The boy, identified in the lawsuit by the initials ""A.G."", has been hospitalized since he was shot May 18 after a car pursuit. A.G. was a passenger in the stolen car and fled on foot ‚Äúas the car was driving‚Äù. Several Chicago police officers chased him on foot. 

>According to witness accounts, while A.G. was running he was told by one or more
of the pursuing CPD officers to put his hands up. A.G. did as he was directed; he put his hands up
with the intent of surrendering to the police. 

>At or about the same time, John Doe Officer, who was running behind A.G. with his
gun unholstered, shot A.G. without cause or justification, causing A.G. to sustain catastrophic and
permanent injuries. A.G. immediately collapsed in the lot of the Marathon gas station. CPD officers did
not render immediate aide to A.G., but instead callously dragged him across the pavement and then
turned their attention to an uninjured officer who crashed into a sign at the gas station while arriving
on scene. 

The filing says the boy did not have a weapon and did nothing to make the officer believe he was armed or a danger to anyone. It adds that the use of force ""was not objectively reasonable"" and ""was neither necessary nor proportional.""

The shooting is part of a pattern of racially discriminatory practices by Chicago police that led the courts and the DOJ to impose a [consent decree](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-police-consent-decree/) on the agency requiring reform and retraining. ‚ÄúThe City of Chicago and its Police Department have been aware of all such findings but have failed to implement reasonable and necessary means to address and resolve the
disproportionate use of force, including deadly force, against minorities that has persisted for years,‚Äù the lawsuit states.

>The City of Chicago is under a Consent Decree due in large part to its longstanding
pattern and practice of using excessive force, including deadly force, disproportionately against
minorities. Tragically, the deep-seeded systemic problems that led to the entry of the Consent Decree
‚Äì implicit bias and failures in training, supervision, and accountability ‚Äì still exist today. A.G. is the
latest victim of CPD‚Äôs systemic failures.

>It is a story all too familiar: a Black or Brown male shot by a CPD officer. In A.G.‚Äôs
case, the shooting occurred during a foot pursuit. Even though the City has known that foot pursuits
are inherently dangerous and there have been numerous incidents where CPD officers chased and
shot fleeing persons who posed no immediate threat, CPD inexplicably resisted implementing any
foot pursuit policy for years. Finally, in June 2021, CPD implemented a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù foot pursuit
policy which has rightly been criticized by thought leaders, community members, and other
stakeholders. CPD was required by the Consent Decree to implement a permanent foot pursuit policy
by September 2021 but missed the deadline. Almost nine months later, there is still no policy.

#Las Cruces

The ACLU is [calling](https://www.aclu-nm.org/en/press-releases/aclu-nm-statement-police-shooting-amelia-baca) for an investigation into the Las Cruces (New Mexico) Police Department after an officer shot and killed a 75-year-old grandma in the midst of a mental health crisis.

Amelia Baca‚Äôs daughter called 911 asking for ‚Äúan officer or an ambulance‚Äù because the elderly woman was ‚Äúgetting really aggressive‚Äù and threatening to kill her. The daughter advised dispatch that Baca had dementia and was armed with a knife, ‚Äústabbing the floor.‚Äù

In bodycam video [released](https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/crime/2022/05/11/body-camera-shows-las-cruces-police-officer-shooting-amelia-baca/9724455002/) earlier this month, the officer stands outside the apartment pointing his gun at Baca, who was armed with a knife in each hand. He can be heard telling her multiple times to drop the knives in english‚ÄîBaca only spoke Spanish. Her daughter and granddaughter can be heard on the footage telling the officer that Baca was mentally ill and asking him to ‚Äútake it easy‚Äù on her.

Within 38 seconds of arriving on scene, the police officer shot and killed Baca.

>‚ÄúWe are respectfully demanding that the [Do√±a Ana County] District Attorney charge this police officer with murder,‚Äù [the family‚Äôs attorney, Sam Bregman] [announced](https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/family-of-75-year-old-shot-killed-by-police-to-hold-news-conference/) Thursday. ‚ÄúThe Baca Family will also be filing suits in federal court and state court for the violation of her constitutional rights.‚Äù

>‚ÄúInstead of assessing the situation, as they are supposedly trained and ordered to do, this police officer shot this 75-year old grandma twice, execution style,‚Äù Bregman said. ‚ÄúThis yelling was all done in English. Ms. Baca is a Spanish speaker and does not understand English.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/v10h1q/police_officer_charged_with_shooting_and_killing/

Rules:

1-Sort general mail for 30 minutes

2-Sort your own mail and prep

3-Place mail on van for driver to delivery

4- Get on van and be dropped of at first delivery point 

5-Await pick up at 09:30 from van and return to office 

One day, I was overloaded with mail, and only me. I asked the manager could I be let off general sort, as I had too much work.

No, you must do what the rules say.

I plead my case, that I simply will not be able to get out on time if he does not waive the ""sort general mail for 30 minutes""  

He will not budge. I must follow the rules, I am told.

OK then. 

I do the general mail sort, by the time I have done all my own prep, the van has left with about me. 

I tell him this and he asks me to drive the mail out in my own car. I refuse, saying it MUST be put in a van and delivered by a driver.   
OK, says he, but I will have to wait for a driver to come back and collect it (and me)

No problem says I, but I am leaving half the mail behind, as I MUST be picked up by 09:30 and as I am already late going out, there is no way I can get finished in the allocated time. 

His face drops, would I like to go stay out on overtime.   


No Thanks

The next day, I get a rare apology from him for him being inflexible.

He said, he had ""a model that predicts the last 2 BTC bottom prices"" and based on this model, predicted what the next bottom price will be. In the comments, he showed a lot of confidence in his complex model, because ""There is a reasoning behind"" it and ""It's gonna happen"".

Okay, so I thought even though two data points is not really great (to be very euphemistic) and using data from those two data points to predict the same data points is, uh, not best practice, I'm curious what sort of factors they included in their model to get to their estimate. Had to be somewhat complex for them to be so convinced, right?

Yeah, no. After eyeballing the ""data"", I immediately saw that the BTC ""model"" was:

* 2013 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6.5
* 2017 bull run: bottom was roughly ATH divided by 6
* prediction: so this time it will be ATH divided by 5.5

Seriously, that's the whole ""model"". His ETH model was even more complex: it's only based on a single data point but hey, that's more than zero I guess? There their prediction, which is calculated ""applying a corrective factor (eth volatility)"" is even more complex: ""ETH bottom is always previous ATH divided by 12"". That's maths for you!

Someone else said in the comments ""If you want to see some real math possibilities, then check out the BTC/ETH rainbow charts."" - Jesus, people! It was literally created [as a joke](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1341061789182791683), there's no maths behind it and no, it doesn't work!

Why am I making this post? Because if you're new-ish to crypto (or just a bit naive) and are seeing a post like that, you might think that those people probably know more than you if they make those predictions, and you might think ""even if they are not precise, how can those data-driven predictions be far off?"". The truth is pretty easy, however: **predictions like that are complete garbage**. Not every prediction is on the level of ""complete this series of numbers"" like the one above, that could be an assignment for like a fourth grader, some include more numbers and complex model specifications. But they're still complete nonsense. 

We simply don't know what will happen - maybe the economy will crash, maybe it will boom, maybe another LUNA-like fiasco will happen. Those things affect how BTC and ETH will behave. You can build a model that perfectly predicts previous ATHs or ATLs or whatever - honestly, it's very, very easy - and it doesn't help you even a bit predicting the future.

**Long story short: all ""technical analysis"" is complete nonsense and you shouldn't fall for it - no matter if it's done by someone on the level of a 10-year old like the OP I am quoting or something more complex.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/v0yg9j/some_people_unfortunately_need_to_hear_this_no/

It was late, about 9 PM, my children were thankfully all asleep in their carseats. 

We were coming up to a red light when the car in front of us tried to run a late yellow turning red. It felt like it happened in slow motion... They were t-boned by a car going across. They were in a small sedan. A truck hit them. They rolled must've been three times before the car settled upside down, horn blaring. The driver of the truck, which was not even damaged, got out and ran to the driver side window. They immediately ran away and were heaved over their knees by their truck. My wife and I were dumbstruck. I'm an ex EMT and felt compelled to assist. I turned on my hazards, told my wife to keep the kids safe, and ran to the car. I regret it so much. 

Their windows were shattered. I crouched down to see who was in the car through the driver's window... That's when I saw a face hanging down. Just a face. Detached from the skull. Hanging off of this poor man's face. A flap of the face, completely removed. He was still conscious, looked right at me. Just muscle on skull and bulging eyes without a face. He was heaving back and forth, breathing erratically and in complete shock. He tried to form words but without lips they didn't make sense. His guttural sounds sounded like, ""Help me."" I couldn't move. I've seen everything under the sun as an EMT, or so I thought, but never this.

I told him to stay still. I checked him for further injuries. As far as I could tell, he was generally bruised and battered but otherwise in one piece. I told him help was on the way. There were sirens in the distance. He was trying to talk to me. It sounded like, ""My phone."" I tried to reach in to his pockets and I cut myself quite badly on my arm from the broken window. I couldn't find anything in his pockets. It likely fell into the downside portion of the car. He grunted and muttered. He looked me in the eye and then his eyes went cold. I've seen it enough. Dead. I backed away and sat on the ground. I felt useless. I feel like a failed him. My experience as an EMT taught me that sometimes there's nothing to do but comfort a person in their last moments. All I feel like I did was frighten him further. Make him feel like there was no hope. He wanted his phone, for me to call or text someone his final words. But I couldn't find it. And as the lights approached and paramedics surrounded me, all I could mutter out between sobs was that he was gone and I couldn't help him. I was helped to the back of an ambulance and given a blanket and a water bottle. I couldn't drink it. I couldn't feel warm. I felt so cold. I still feel so cold. I was the last thing that man saw and I did nothing for him but promise him nothings. 

I've had vivid nightmares every night. My wife has scheduled trauma therapy for me starting tomorrow. One thing I must mention is he wasn't wearing a seat belt. Please wear your seat belts. For the love of God or whatever you do or don't believe in, wear your seat belts. Please..

TL;DR I'm an ex EMT and felt obliged to help an injured driver. I will regret what I saw for the rest of my life. WEAR. YOUR. SEAT. BELT.

Addition:
Thank you everyone who has responded. Your words of comfort, advice, and experiences have genuinely helped me more than I can express. I want to reach out to each of you, I tried to start a reply, but it feels like the words won't come out. I will respond to each of you in time. You deserve that. 

To those who messaged me asking for more details. I will share... He was not hanging from his seat belt. His seat belt would have saved him. It would've kept him from impacting the front windshield and would've held him upright away from the roof of the car and broken glass. Those asking how his face was injured... I suspect the front windshield, though only God knows. I don't feel right sharing more. I think I said too much already. What I will say, is to wear your seat belt. Even on a 4 minute drive... You never know. You just never know. 

To those who messaged me asking me why I shared here and not to a therapist. I have trauma therapy scheduled tomorrow morning. I have been granted two weeks leave from my work and I am very grateful for it. I posted here after an old EMT friend of mine recommended it as way of venting and receiving support. I've used Reddit before but now know it can be so much more meaningful than entertainment. You are all very wonderful people and I thank you sincerely and deeply. I wish you all wellness, health, and safety. Please wear your seat belts, pay attention, stop at yellows, and drive defensively. God bless you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v0wcyu/tifu_by_traumatizing_myself_for_life_please_i_beg/

Lucci is ""KO"", but he is still in his leopard form. A marine announced Luffy's win, but there has been no narrator's box. Also, Lucci seems barely hurt.

So my theory is: Lucci will get back up and use a new Power up. The attack on Enies Lobby will fail.

It is quite obvious, really. Oda is trying to throw a curveball at us here. The big reversal is coming. In chapter 428 or 429, Lucci will get back up for Round 2. The WG are the main antagonists of the story. Luffy isn't strong enough to just waltz into their government/judiciary facility like this. It doesn't make sense.

There are also no stakes. Nobody of the SHs died. Lucci has been built up for many chapters since Water 7. We also know Zoans are very resilient and can get back up. There's even a Buster Call here. The SHs will be utterly defeated here. Then there will be real tension and stakes. Eventually, all SHs will have to fight together to beat Lucci and escape, just barely.",https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/v11z2t/theory_the_attack_on_enies_lobby_will_fail/

My dog died last month and like any other NORMAL human being I cried. However, because I'm weird, sadness usually turns into rage or hatred. It's probably normal (maybe). 

So after I was all cried out, I went back to normalish. I didn't cry, but I wasn't super happy either. My neighbors knocked on my door to ""comfort us"". They gave us cookies, but looked at me weird, bc i wasn't crying. So they started talking to be and asked me why i wasn't crying (this happened a bit ago so idk some of the details)

&#x200B;

Them: ""Are you ok? You seem a little upet""

Me: ""I am upset, thanks.""

Them: ""It's just, you're not crying""

\*silence\*

Them: I just think you should be sadder! Isn't it weird to be so normal???????

Me: ""I'm fine. I think its time for you to go'

They talk in that mock sympathetic voice for a bit, until my mom tactfully tells them i need to go to sleep. Not a big story, but im kinda mad",https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/v109ft/neighbors_confused_because_im_not_crying/

-----

Christians only have two beliefs:

* Give birth as fast as possible, as many times as possible

* Aggressively do the exact opposite of anything that might benefit the human race, even if you have to use violence/guns to force it

-----

The hordes of uneducated, racist, violent, anti-education/science Christians have proven over the last five years that they are prepared to literally destroy Earth before they will allow humanity to progress forward.

[Full post link](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uz3yld/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_to_stop_treating/)

**Original**

I (19f) met my best friend Lucian (19M) at HS. I really liked him at 16 and when I confessed he said he was gay. I accepted it and moved on. But since we really got along together we stayed friends. Fast forward to sometime, we got into the same college, we do everything together and even have the same friend group. He starts referring to me as ""the Mrs."", and ""the wife""; later on he becomes jealous of any guy I'm with. And the most recent ""incident"" happened when a mutual friend asked me in front of Lucian if I still liked Lucian. Of, I said no, it was 3 years ago, I moved on. Lucian became awfully quiet and said, ""well yes of course like everyone"". Tbh, it felt weird, but I didn't say anything at the moment until another friend, later on, mentioned to me that she was surprised we weren't dating.

Most of our friends know he is gay, but those who don't assume we were together because of comments such as ""I can't you know, the Mrs. won't let me"" or ""You should talk about this with the wife"" At first it was funny? because he was,,, gay? But now people who I'm interested in won't date me because they think I'm trying to cheat on Lucian.

So I told him about this and he blew up and said that he was ""flattered"" I still thought we could be together but he wasn't interested. He, later on, insisted that I was making too many conjectures and stuff, at which I simply said ""stop saying I'm your wife you fucking moron"". Some friends think that I'm overreacting, and most of them simply think that he should respect that I don't want to be associated with him romantically.

**Update**

So I read most of the comments, tho I didn't reply because I truly didn't think there was anything to say. I showed this post to Lucian, which seemed the only honest attempt at recovering our friendship.

Here's some backstory: when I confessed I was a messy 16 yo, so naturally I asked my friend to tell him through text. At which he said he didn't see me that way. I was super embarrassed, and didn't talk to him until one day he said something like ""well, I'm gay, that's why I said no"". It was fine, I understood and we moved on.

But now Lucian said that back then he didn't feel comfortable by rejecting me and he wasn't gay in the first place. So, yeah. He apologized for that and said that he was Bi, but that he couldn't deal with a relationship at the time and didn't want to lose me. I was -tho I'm embarrassed- a yaoi lover back in hs -I'M SORRY OK- and he thought that was the only way we could still be friends.

He says that he wanted to be with me. I said that it would be a bit weird and he offered to go on a date. So that's what we're doing lmao this is WEIRD but I'm young so fuck it.

These fixes generally range from borrowing some Pathfinder 2e mechanics to playing Pathfinder 2e instead. Jokes aside, while a lot of these ideas seem interesting, a part of me just doesn't see such changes ever being implemented, since a lot of it seems to conflict with WoTC's design philosophy, and the general direction they appear to be taking.

However, I'm certain Wizards is aware of the concerns regarding class imbalance. So, I thought it might be a fun exercise to imagine approaching class re-balancing from their perspective, perhaps even speculate how they may approach any revisions to the core classes in 2024, given the direction they have been heading in so far.

For instance, [this](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/phC7pp_cL6nb) is what I imagine the Monk would be, as redesigned by Wizards of the Coast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/v1atra/how_to_redesign_classes_wotc_style/

I never learned about the world other than the basics I learned in school, and once I read a book of the entire history of Japan. I never really thought about the world outside of America. I recently moved to Sweden and my world view became bigger, learning about the Nordic countries.

Recently I've been watching videos from the YouTube channel Geography Now, and... there's just so much out there I had no idea of. Specifically, I just finished the video on Pakistan, and almost every single thing about the country, culture, the people, the history, food, everything, is completely different with what I'm familiar with. It's like an alternate universe.

From the ancient history of China, to the constant struggles of Poland, the diversity of India, the multitude of ethnicities and languages I've never heard of, humanity has so much range. I'm kind of blown away.

I haven't even learned about the multitude of cultures and countries in Africa yet. It's truly amazing to step out of my bubble and explore what's out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/v0xgd0/the_world_is_so_much_bigger_and_more_diverse_than/

There were no drive-throughs and our food started and ended with pastries. It was a coffeeshop, a ""Third Place."" Congenial, friendly, intimate, fun. 

I left for a long time. During this time Howard Schulz stepped down and McCafe started. Starbucks felt threatened by this cheaper, industrial, no-personality option. The smell of food began to overwhelm the smell of espresso, the drive-through began to overwhelm the caf√©, the mobile orders came, and the look and feel of the fun beatnik hangout spot turned into a corporate industry frantically running against time. The look of happiness on the barista's faces was replaced by a grim and overwhelmed blankness.

The coffees, too, disappeared. Arabian Mocha Java, Sulaweisi, Kenya, Sanani, New Guinea Peaberry... the interesting and fun variety subsumed into the bland and mediocre Pike Place and a few others to adapt to a market Starbucks was never meant to cater to. 

Starbucks is at a loss trying to figure out how to improve connection scores and the Third Place feel. Well, that's really dumb. They know what the problem is; they have to. It's not just me that said this stuff, Howard Schulz said it himself repeatedly. It's no secret. 

If you want to be a Third Place, it can't be industrial. If you want it to be industrial, it can't be a Third Place.  Get rid of the drive through, get rid of the fast food. If you wanna be McDonald's, don't be shocked when you lose the soul.

He walks up to the front porch and speaks clearly to nothing.  ‚ÄúDungeon Thedeim.  The Dungeoneer‚Äôs Guild would like to officially declare your intention as we understand it, and treatise with your Dwellers.  Please bring forth your Voice, so it may be heard.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Fine by me.  Teemo, if you would?  My rat scion just nods from the shortcut he‚Äôs in, and soon scurries out from under the porch.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm here.  What do you need?‚Äù he asks with his typical lack of decorum.  The elf simply looks to him with enough solemnity to make up for it, and speaks.


&nbsp;

‚ÄúThe Dungeoneer‚Äôs Guild does hereby declare you to be a Cooperative Dungeon.  We recognize the benefits you can grant, as do we recognize they are not simply free.  Your mercy has been noted, and in appreciation, the Guild will attempt to inform delvers of the rules as we know them.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Teemo just grunts at the flowery language.  ‚ÄúOk, what‚Äôs that actually mean?‚Äù  Tarl smiles and squats down to be more on Teemo‚Äôs level, dropping the formal act, his declaration apparently finished.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúIt means that as long as you don‚Äôt just kill delvers because you can, the Guild will do its best to make sure they behave and don't make a mess.‚Äù

&nbsp;

My rat nods at that.  ‚ÄúGood.  That‚Äôs pretty much all the Boss wants.‚Äù  I nudge Teemo, reminding him of a question I‚Äôve had.  ‚ÄúOh yeah, he also wants to know what would happen if he expanded into the town?‚Äù

&nbsp;

Elf Guy gives him a confused look.  ‚ÄúIs he planning to?‚Äù

&nbsp;

‚ÄúNot exactly,‚Äù he says, shaking his head.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one of the options, apparently.  Part of why he expanded down a while ago was he didn‚Äôt know what would happen if he tried to expand out more.‚Äù

&nbsp;

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù says, the inspector as he takes a seat on one of the stairs.  ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure Thedeim can guess, it‚Äôd be complicated.  Everyone would technically become Dwellers.  Some would approve, some wouldn‚Äôt, and some wouldn‚Äôt care.  The mayor would probably be upset, and it‚Äôd cause political ripples through the kingdom.‚Äù  He shrugs.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd recommend against him expanding outward, at least on the surface.  He‚Äôll be stepping on a lot of toes if he does.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Teemo just nods at that.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs about what he figured, yeah.  Anyway, you wanted to talk with the Ratkin, too?‚Äù

&nbsp;

Tarl nods and stands.  ‚ÄúYeah.  I have a formal treaty to normalize relations with them and the Guild, and by extension the kingdom and even the world.  They‚Äôre sovereign, technically.  Dungeons are their own territory, which is why expanding outward would be complicated at best.  The treatsie basically just says they‚Äôre recognized as such and offers trade deals.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Teemo sticks out his ratty tongue in mock-disgust.  ‚ÄúThat sounds like politics, bleh.  Better them than me.  You can head to the Enclave on your own.  That Ratkin enchanter came by the other day and cleared the magical traps out.‚Äù  He pauses for a moment before speaking up again.  ‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôll escort you.  The Boss is also working on a new challenge.‚Äù

&nbsp;

The elf‚Äôs eyes light up at that.  ‚ÄúOh?  After the labyrinth, that sounds intriguing.‚Äù  The two talk as they head into the house, and Teemo hops on Tarl‚Äôs shoulder to make it easier on the both of them.  He explains the concept as he guides the inspector, who seems confused at my sudden embracing of traps.  I notice Tarl looking around the rat nest in the basement, trying to be subtle as he walks.  I should see if I can‚Äôt leverage that desire to get something out of the ODA‚Ä¶ though I have no idea what I‚Äôd want.

&nbsp;

Before I can get too deep into thinking of that I‚Äôd want, though, I feel new feet at the manor gate.  Why are most groups trios?  Maybe it gives the best balance of versatility versus splitting loot too many ways.  They look a bit‚Ä¶ off, though.  I think I‚Äôve seen most of the local delvers before, and these three don‚Äôt look local.  Their armor and clothes look like they‚Äôve seen a lot of miles, and are expected to see a lot more.

&nbsp;

The leader seems to be a troll of some kind: kinda tall and lanky, purplish rough skin, beady eyes.  He has a pair of shortswords crossed over his back, with chainmail underneath.  I‚Äôm thinking another melee damage class like that one elf a while ago, but with swords instead of a spear.

&nbsp;

It looks like their designated mage is a druid?  And a halfling, too.  I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs a druid, at least.  She‚Äôs riding a wolf and doesn‚Äôt have weapons like I‚Äôd expect a ranger or something to have.  She has a gnarled staff with bones, teeth, scales, and feathers hanging off it.  I would say it looks hand-made, but I get a good sense of power from it.  And, come to think of it, probably everything is technically hand made.  I don‚Äôt think there are magical factories around.

&nbsp;

The last member is an olive-skinned elf, which is interesting.  Is that a wood elf?  Or is that a regular elf and the other elves have been eladrin?  Maybe he just has a good tan?  Eh, I‚Äôm going with wood elf until told different.  He‚Äôs dressed in hide armor and seems to have a bunch of boomerangs, of all things.  Taking a closer look, though, they‚Äôre metal and look to be really sharp.  He wears thick gloves to protect himself.  I would think that‚Äôd mess with his aim, but with how his eyes move, I get the feeling that‚Äôs not going to be a problem.

&nbsp;

The wood elf speaks up first.  ‚ÄúSo this is the new toybox?‚Äù

&nbsp;

The halfling shrugs.  ‚ÄúLooks like.  Unless you think big creepy mansions have infestations of adventurers to go with the spiders and mice?‚Äù

&nbsp;

The elf glares at her, but the troll speaks up before they can get a proper bicker rolling.  ‚ÄúCram it.  I heard that gnome priest got one hell of a prize from beating one of the scions.‚Äù  That gets the other two to shut up, and also makes me squint at the small party as he continues.  ‚ÄúSo we just gotta find a scion to beat up.  Not the spider.  I want a fresh chest.  You spot anything, Hark?‚Äù

&nbsp;

The elf, apparently Hark, looks around before looking up.  He grins as he spots Poe up on the chimney.  ‚ÄúRaven scion up there, Vnarl.‚Äù  The troll looks up, using a hand to cover his eyes, and grins.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúPerfect!  Mlynda, help him draw it down here.  I don‚Äôt want to fight it in its lair.‚Äù  The halfling and elf nod.  Hark tosses one of his boomerangs, while Mlynda summons a thorny vine out of my nice lawn, and has it throw thorns at my Marshal.

&nbsp;

Poe just looks at them with contempt as their attacks either fail to reach him, or are easy for him to duck without even getting out of his nest.  As they continue to try to draw him out, I wonder if they‚Äôre very stubborn, or very stupid.  Almost none of their attacks are actually on target, thanks to the distance and the height.  Poe has the high ground, and there‚Äôs not a whole lot they can do about it.

&nbsp;

Except get frustrated.  Which they do.  I wonder if the ranged barrage is their main tactic.  The boomerangs always come back, so their ranged fighter never really runs out of ammo, and the druid seems to be able to coax an infinite amount of thorns out of that vine.  The troll, however, is getting bored *and* frustrated, but soon spots something to take it out on.

&nbsp;

One of my ratlings has an armful of wood from the maze, and Yvonne is helping it.  I guess she wanted to get up and do something, rather than just read books all day with her down time.  Vnarl, however, seems to just see two walking sacks of experience.  He darts forward and cuts down the poor ratling, much to the surprise of Yvonne.  She gives him a glare before speaking up.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúWhat do you think you‚Äôre doing?!‚Äù

&nbsp;

He just grins and slowly steps forward.  ‚ÄúI heard you died, Yvonne.  Let me help you with that‚Ä¶‚Äù

&nbsp;

While the raven had been content to ignore the pests when they were just bothering him, he doesn‚Äôt appreciate them hindering the ratlings in their duty.  He especially doesn‚Äôt appreciate the threatening tone and stance their leader has towards Yvonne, and neither do I.  Stop them, Poe.  And try not to kill them.

&nbsp;

The caw Poe gives as he spreads his wings is otherworldly in its menace, and I can practically hear a certain evil red genie declare that you‚Äôd be surprised what you can live through.  It draws the attention of the other delvers around the manor, and the unwelcome party all grin as they finally get a rise out of my raven scion.  Ravens and crows circle around and blot out the sun over them, and Yvonne takes the chance to slip away.

&nbsp;

Poe is looking significantly more bad-ass than I expected.  I check his status and see something I hadn‚Äôt before.

&nbsp;

**Poe, Raven Scion**

**Lord of Unkindnesses**

**Marshal of Murders**

&nbsp;

‚Ä¶when did he become a raid boss?

***Background***

This all starts on 4chan. Created almost 2 decades ago by a teenager that wanted to talk about anime, 4chan is one of the most infamous sites on the internet. It has several boards but the most infamous are that of /r9k/, /b/, and /pol/. /pol/ is definitely the most infamous, especially after 2016, and for good reason. You'll have people of many different flags spewing all sorts of hatred, either as a joke or serious, and there's no way to tell who's who due to the anonymous nature of it. You won't be shocked that Hitler is viewed in a good light and that they like to do a bit of trolling (see: He Will Not Divide Us). Ironically, saying progressive views on there will get you more seething replies than if you had just said ""race war now"".

Fast forward to 2010 and My Little Pony gets a new show and *dominates* the internet for a few years. 2012 marks the year that /mlp/ is marked as a containment board and Global Rule 15 is instated: thou shall not post ponies outside of /mlp/ or risk getting a ban. This is a very strict rule that almost never fails in getting enforced. That is how it's been, besides one little exception.

***Happy April Fools***

Most websites like to do a little joke to celebrate April 1st and 4chan is no exception. 4/1/2017 was an interesting experiment. The idea was to merge 2 boards into one. Examples include: 

/co/ (comics and cartoons) + /ck/ (cooking) = /cock/ (cooking and comics)

 /fa/ (fashion) + /p/ (photography) = /fap/ (fashion and photography). You get the gist.

The one that stood out the most? /mlpol/ aka My Little Politics. Now this was a shocker, they combined the nazis with the horse fans? Something about /pol/ is that there are actually boomers that use it. So it's funny to think a 50 something Trump voter is now suddenly confronted with Rainbow Dash  on their screen. 

Now, eveyone is stunned because they didn't know their boards would become fused. But the chaos was certainly something to behold.

***Red and Blue***

4chan is split between what is known as red boards and blue boards. Red boards permit NSFW (examples: /pol/, /hm/, /s/, etc.) but blue boards forbid it and if you post porn, your post is removed and a ban is issued. They are called red and blue is because of the default background color used. If you went on /tv/, the color theme is blue while /h/ has a red color. An easy way to tell which is which. Now, this is important for the following reason: /mlp/ is a blue board. You can't post rule34 on it. And the Brony fandom *absolutely* is notorious for ""clop"" (pony porn). It's no joke that the main character Twilight Sparkle is the character with the most porn in existence. That's not me exaggerating, FiM at its peak was an entirely different beast back then. And you see, when one of the prominent brony spaces bans porn from being anonynously posted, you have a segment that just wants to let loose but they can't so they keep balancing on a certain line.

So when /mlpol/ happened, it was red because the other board was red. And bronies absolutely l e t l o o s e upon getting that redlight. Pony porn galore was what the first few hours looked like. Imagine a middle aged r/the_donald user going to /pol/ and [seeing Pinkie Pie's genitals](https://www.reddit.com/r/DankMemeArchive/comments/62zyky/4chan_mlpol_has_created_some_unintended_effects/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) or Applejack eating out Rarity (i know, a terrible day to be literate).

The two sides took shots at each other at first and everyone expected for both of them to destroy each other by the end of the day. But.....


***The Alliance***

After the intial wave of porn posting did both sides get along with one another. /pol/ users felt as if this prank was like a fresh new start, one of the best days it had in years compared to the low effort spam that clutteted the catalog. They felt like real political discussion was happening. Lots of Aryanne (Nazi Pony OC) posting and similar art was made as a way to bond over 2 boards fusing. As for the bronies, the porn posting felt liberating and there was a lot of edge from them too.

But this prank was only ever meant to last for 1 day and with April 2nd fast approaching, did everyone start getting disappointed. They didn't want it to end.

When the new dawn occurred, users voiced their support for having /mlpol/ be a permanent fixture on 4chan. Because so many wanted it to stay, there were (false) rumors that the mods would concede and were holding votes on the matter.  People were so passionate over letting /mlpol/ stay that they even made their own little declaration of independence called [""The Edicts of Equestria/Policies of Polestria""](https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/1209608/#1209608). But to no avail.

***Discord enters the picture***

After the 1st, /mlp/ and /pol/ were split again and by the 3rd, /mlpol/ was already in its dying breath. Users tried to rally in the original parent boards but neither were having it. The fun was done but they weren't giving up just yet. Discord servers were made and just like the namesake of the god of Chaos did they set out to raid /qa/ and cause a chaotic protest for the mods to reinstate /mlpol/. Now, this was happening when most mods were inactive and the few that did see it rejected the proposal in [IRC](https://desuarchive.org/qa/thread/1241483/#1241524).

/pol/ is not liked by the people that run 4chan and neither is /mlp/ and they didn't want another board with them to exist. /pol/ particularly gave moot (the creator of 4chan) trouble and it was deleted in the early days before being brought back. But the reason /pol/ is still around is because it acts like a containment board (though not a good one) and should it get deleted now, the drama that would unfold would be biblical and the other 4chan boards would be swamped with them.

/qa/ was where the battle happened and the mods kept banning and removing /mlpol/ forces for breaking GR15 and the people that use /qa/ (/jp/ users who are otakus) didn't like the pony posting either so there was a lot of back and forth arguing happening.

But despite his acknowledgement, he did not try to make /mlpol/ permanent.

***Harmony prevails***

 For over a week, /qa/ was losing the fight that the angry /mlpol/ soldiers were raging against. The mods decide to freeze the board to prevent anyone else posting threads. This was a victory and everyone started to regroup at splinter sites, primarily mlpol.net. But the original /mlpol/ was never brought back and the only thing achieved was /qa/ being nuked. /qa/ is currently frozen but that is due to their failed raid on /lgbt/ back in November, not because the mods are afraid of /mlpol/. /s4s/ accepted /qa/ natives but no raid happened. /po/, the origami board (not to be confused with its eviler twin), was briefly raided but it all fizzled out. It was clear 4chan was no longer their home and /mlpol/ permanently resides on mlpol.net. To this day, some consider April Fools 2017 the best one yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/v12s0l/my_little_pony_mlpol_the_time_4chan_mods/

&#x200B;

My former best friend and I knew us since high school days. We always had a lot of fun together, even if he wasn't one of the ""hip"" ones, it didn't bother me because our friendship was pure. He had to carry his package like many others. Secretly he was gay and didn't tell me for years out of fear.  

Finally I found out by chance, I didn't care with whom he went to bed and the enthusiasm could be seen in his eyes.

&#x200B;

A few more years passed and our friendship grew stronger and stronger, until one fateful day.

&#x200B;

About 4 years ago he called me in tears and apologized for something and claimed it was not his fault or intention.

I asked him what had happened. I did not get an answer for the time being. A few days later the police came to his apartment and secured all the hard drives and smartphones.

The charge? Consumption of child pornography.

I was shocked and disgusted, he had to go to psychological care which was ordered by the court.

I avoided contact after that, but he remained stubborn and asked me for help and that he would get better. He had a boyfriend for the last few years, so I thought he was making progress.

&#x200B;

I thought

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago I found out that the use of CP has started again. For a long time I struggled with the moral questions of what to do. After all, we have been friends for 12 years, right?

Last week I made a decision and reported him to the police. It would be unforgivable for me to read in 10 years that a child was raped and I could have prevented it.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just some Infos for better understanding. He himself was a Victim of Sexual Abuse as a Minor. That was the reason i didn't ditched him the first time because i thought, he is a Victim too, and maybe he could be helped, i was a fool i know. But the signs back then gave me the hope it could be possible. He had a loving Relationship with a Partner for over 3 Years before he dumped him. They even lived together.

\++++++++++  
Hey everybody, we‚Äôve promised to give you an update on the situation so here it is.

In late summer 2021, BlackStarForge approached us with his idea to develop a video game together. He already had first concepts with copies of our art and design that he shared with us. We didn‚Äôt have the resources at the time for another project but encouraged him to go ahead and make the game on his own, as we loved the idea. 

And we asked him to remove our art and designs from his prototype ‚Äì this was an issue for us from the very beginning and we were very clear about it. But we also wanted to help, so we offered to provide contacts to illustrators to help him with the creation process.   
We wrote him:

>*Regarding copyright and illustration: We can‚Äôt provide any detailed guidelines at this point, as our resources are limited, and we don‚Äôt want to encourage people to create designs which can be mistaken as our designs.*  
>  
>*If you want to go down the flat shaded 2D road, please make sure your visual language is NOT A COPY of Kurzgesagt Design but represents ITS OWN STYLE. I‚Äôm sure a skilled Illustrator will help you to develop your own, unique visual language, or at least make sure that your project will trigger thoughts like: ‚ÄúReminds me of Kurzgesagt‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúThis is Kurzgesagt‚Äù*

Or in another email:

>*The only rule we can give you at this point is to not copy our design 1:1. If let‚Äôs say you had a dyson sphere in your game, then make sure you create a version that differs from our design.* 

We felt like supporting another creator and thus spent more time than we would have with other people approaching us. We wrote emails, had zoom calls, and eventually even provided him with visual guideline examples.

In February, we received an update, which again, looked very similar to our style, to the point where his design could be mistaken for ours.

We‚Äôve had another call and *once again* asked him to clearly differentiate his visual approach from ours. It could not have been an honest mistake, because while all of this was going on, BlackStarForge posted [a thread on our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kurzgesagt/comments/sh2b8w/is_it_close_enough_to_how_kurzgesagt_would_do_it/)  with the title: ‚ÄûIs it close enough to how kurzgesagt would do it?‚Äù

Then finally, on April 28th, BlackStarForge sent us another update, but sadly nothing had changed. So we responded by asking him to change three things: 

Change the title, remove the earth from the logo and pick a design that doesn‚Äôt imply the game is made by us. 

We reiterated that we kindly ask him not to make the game appear as if we were involved with it and that we reserve the right to take legal action if we discover a violation of copyright, trademark protection, and/or IP. We did *not* send a cease and desist or threaten him, as it was implied. We also never asked him to end the project.

In the end, for us, it is unacceptable that people might mistake the game as an official kurzgesagt game, due to the combination of art style, font, and overall look and feel. This crosses a hard line for us. We are copied a lot and there are people making stuff deliberately trying to look as much as we do to make money (because it is always cheaper to copy instead of making something original). 

Please know that this only applies to the commercial side of things. Fan projects, visuals created in our art style, or interpretations of our creations are absolutely fine. As long as there is no commercial ulterior motive, we love that our work is inspiring other creatives (as we are inspired by others!).

We‚Äôve never asked BlackStarForge to stop the development - quite the opposite: From the very beginning, we took the time over many emails and calls to make it clear where he went too far. From the very beginning on we were nothing but positive about his project. We even offered to do shoutouts on Social Media once the game was done. But it had to be clearly distinct from what we do, so one could tell immediately that this was not made by us. 

As BlackStarForge made the decision to end the project, and the internet being the internet, some people made this to be about a big creator being mean to a small one or tried to invoke creator drama. As far as we can tell, neither BlackStarForge nor us is interested in that and if you are a fan of Kurzgesagt, we would hope you are not, too. 

This is the story from our perspective and for us this is really all there is to say about it. We hope we have cleared up all open questions and we also hope that you understand that we can‚Äôt allow commercial projects that imply on purpose that we are associated with them.
