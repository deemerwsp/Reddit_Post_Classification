No TL:DR because it's not that long and reading stories is the whole point of the sub.

Anyways back in college I worked at an on campus fast food place. Your basic burgers, fries, wraps and small salads. My shift started at 11:25 doing wraps until 11:55 when Josh left and I manned the grill and someone else did wraps.

Now Josh was a typical Josh and it was his way or the highway. He'd get really mad when I'd throw more burgers on the grill or flip something while he was trying to chat up the dishwasher. I did this because he had no understanding of how much food was required to feed college kids during the small breaks between classes. Eventually he complained enough that I was told ""Josh is on the grill until 11:55 so stop pestering him and do your station""

So I did. I stopped touching the grill.

The next shift he leaves at 11:55 and I get on the grill and immediately throw down 40 frozen raw burger patties. 2 minutes later the cashier starts yelling ""where are the burgers""

Sorry, I just got on the grill and Josh only had 5 in the warmer and 3 in the window. I know we always have about 100 students between 11:55 and 12:20, and they almost all get the burger meal but I was told not to touch the grill.

The burgers  finish after a few minutes and the next batch goes on but the grill has cooled a little so they take even longer. The line of kids waiting for food is longer than the line ordering and management is pissed. I get chewed out for not being fast enough and just ask ""do you want raw burgers, or to talk to Josh""

It only took 1 more shift of this for them to realize that my meddling was actually what kept us afloat during the lunch rush. I'd often cook an entire grill of burgers while he was swinging and missing with the dishwasher. They eventually printed out a sheet of how many burgers/chicken etc needed to be prepped for certain rush times and gave Josh a very stern talking to about how to be a team player. 

Also, josh sucked because he'd cook all the burgers well done. Like really well done. Then they'd sit in the warmer for another 5-15 minutes (he didn't know how to rotate either) so you were eating God damn hockey pucks. He ruined so much ground beef. He eventually got moved to salads and stock because he couldn't be trusted with anything that was fast paced.

Ever since I was a kid I loved how peanut butter used to taste. Not only did it taste good, but it had this weird ""spice,"" to it that wasn't like a chili pepper type spice, but wholly unique that I never tasted in other foods. It was the perfect accent when mixed with jelly, as the spiciness and the sweetness went together perfectly. Sometimes I'd ""eat too fast,"" and have a bit of a hard time breathing, but I never thought anything of it. I also remember getting some weird looks a few times as a kid talking about spicy peanut butter, but didn't think anything of that either.

One day a few months ago, I (25m) was staying at my parents house and went to make myself some lunch. I saw some peanut butter in the pantry, but no jelly so since I was hungry I slammed about an inch of peanut butter between two slices of bread and remember thinking ""wow, this is the most peanut butter I've ever eaten at once,"" but then got to work devouring my creation.

This is where the fuckup starts. A few bites in I got that ""ate too fast,"" feeling again and had to take a break to catch my breath. I started eating again and immediately got the ate-too-fast feeling again. *Damn, it's going to take me forever to eat this sandwich* I thought, so I became determined to just power through and finish it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Big Mistake.

I made it to about the half way point before I knew something was wrong. It felt simultaneously like there was a rock stuck in my windpipe and like somebody had filled my lungs with peanut butter. Weezing and struggling to breath, it fucking *hurt*. The amount of time it took to take a full breath was causing me to panic and felt like I was trying to fill up a hot air balloon with a straw. I immediately started googling ""heart attack symptoms,"" but they didn't really match up. I then googled the symptoms themselves and results of ""symptoms of allergic reactions,"" started coming up. Some of the main symptoms were difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. Then I scrolled further down and saw a section about ""things to watch out for in children,"" and the top one was... the child says their ""mouth feels hot,"" or that they say non-spicy food is spicy.

After a painfully long period of time I started being able to breath again and suddenly all the weird looks I got from talking about spicy peanut butter made sense! Peanut butter wasn't spicy, I'd just been poisoning myself all these years! I now use peanut butter alternatives and mix my jelly with ""sweet Asian chili jelly,"" I pick up from the store and it's just as good, but doesn't almost kill me.

TLDR: I thought peanut butter was supposed to taste spicy, turns out I'm just an idiot and allergic to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uz2n3r/tifu_by_thinking_peanut_butter_was_supposed_to_be/

We are having exams coming up and I have a huge moral dilemma. I am a lecturer at a university and one of the subjects I teach is related to phonology and pronunciation. We teach our students Castillan Spanish.

This year, I have a first year student who refuses to follow pronunciation that is being taught. She (Ava, obviously a fake name) uses a different dialect, very distinct one with a lot of very different sounds, aspirated consonant, etc. However, the dialect is very much understandable, and she uses correct grammar, etc. Admittedly, she has excellent pronunciation, much better than we would expect from our 3rd year students but it‚Äôs not something we teach. I have asked her before to try and adhere to the pronunciation guide we teach them but she said that she learned it watching TV and picked up the accent that way and it comes naturally to her and if she tried to change it, she wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as fluent in her speech as she is now.

Technically, she isn‚Äôt doing anything wrong by using a different dialect, she‚Äôs very good at it and she‚Äôs one of our top students but I don‚Äôt think we should make exceptions as other students, who are not as good, will then expect the same leeway. Especially that I believe that her stubbornness and refusal to even try is disrespectful to lecturers and may come across as if she‚Äôs feeling that she‚Äôs better than others and rules don‚Äôt apply to her. Buuut, course requirements don‚Äôt have specific dialect listed.

We have oral exams coming up soon and I am considering failing her if she doesn‚Äôt use dialect that is taught. I spoke to my colleagues and some of them agree with me but others have said that IWBTA because she‚Äôs not making mistakes and shouldn‚Äôt be failed for the way she speaks especially that this is how a language is used natively in some countries.. But we fail students if they speak with really bad pronunciation so I don‚Äôt see why I shouldn‚Äôt fail her for speaking with different one. So WIBTA if I failed her?


*[OOP was deemed the asshole.]*


[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uz20x6/update_wibta_if_i_failed_my_student_because_she/)

I figured that those who read the post would appreciate an update regarding the student you tried to protect.

I read your comments and you‚Äôre right, I would‚Äôve been an ass if I failed her.

Her pronunciation is excellent and it would be a shame to force her to change it. I made my decision and I think you‚Äôll be happy to find out what it was and how her exam went.

Had a chat with Ava and told her how well she‚Äôs done this year. I explained that students are taught specific pronunciation but there‚Äôs no correct/incorrect accent and we will not expect her to change it seeing how well she‚Äôs doing. But since we teach certain pronunciation, she‚Äôs expected to know pronunciation rules we teach and told her to just know the difference in pronunciation without actually having to implement it.

During her exam, she was asked a few questions regarding pronunciation differences and the rest was just the standard exam conversation and presentation. She was marked based on the dialect she speaks.

She passed with flying colors and, she doesn‚Äôt know it yet, but will receive scholarship next year for her grades. And going forward, we‚Äôll make sure that students who speak with different dialect will get full grades as long as they know the differences in pronunciation between regions (which we require anyway but wasn‚Äôt part of the exam).",https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/uz3tg1/wibta_if_i_failed_my_student_because_she_speaks/

Edit: For those who assume I think any part of this situation is funny... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy).  Also who gave me a Wholesome award? That's seriously messed up.

Edit 2:  For those claiming it's ""too soon""...  I respectfully disagree, I think this is the perfect time.  The pain won't ever go away for those families - there will never be a time when they'll think ""Sure, it's been long enough - go ahead and laugh about it.""  However, the anger and shock felt by the general public will begin to fade as other news stories and other tragedies steal our attention.  Better to elicit stronger emotions now and hopefully, in a tiny imperceptible way, increase the likelihood of meaningful change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/uyvdk0/how_many_texas_cops_does_it_take_to_save_children/

Throughout my career I have CONSTANTLY get emails from people that start with ""hi William, 
..."" For years I didn't correct people, but it's just gotten out of hand. I've made my name bold in my email signature, capitalized it, everything I can do. But some people still can't figure it out. it's astounding how much it happens with people that have had multiple emails with me, even people within my own organization.

So my new policy is I let it go the first time. but if someone does it more than a couple times, I start referring to them as their last name minus a letter.

e.g. if a repeat offender named ""frank smith"" emails me and calls me ""William,"" I respond with ""Hi Smit, ..."" and continue doing so until they fix their mistake. 

A lot of people figure out what I'm doing and quietly fix their mistake in the future, but some people never figure it out, and to this day probably think I'M the idiot. Oh well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/uyytyf/cant_bother_to_figure_out_my_name_well_you_have_a/

The last chapter is on the first person to set foot in Hawaii, but it talks about Polynesian exploration in general really.

It absolutely blew my mind.

The author just offhandedly mentioned how sweet potatoes from Chile have been found in New Zealand, indicating there were trade routes covering thousands of miles traversed in essentially Catamarans. A quick google search afterwards revealed there‚Äôs a lot of DNA & Linguistic evidence backing up that this ain‚Äôt just speculation at this point ‚Äî the word for root vegetable is earilly similar between Chileans and distant Pacific Islanders, for example. From a Nat Geo article:

> And the Polynesian name for the root vegetable‚Äî""kuumala""‚Äîresembles its names in the Andean Quechua language: ""kumara"" and ""cumal.""

How the hell is nobody talking about this??

Was betrayed at the massacre of Quincy, yet still continued to fight for those who can‚Äôt. 

Assumes a leadership role in saving civilians when the Colonel Hollis is killed and guides them through the commonwealth with a few remaining minutemen. 

His group gets attacked in Jamaica plains, still keeps fighting and leading the few that are left to safety.

Watches ferals take more lives of his group in Lexington, continues to fight and lead his group again through the commonwealth.

Ends up trapped in the museum in Concord, surrounded by raiders, and still continues to fight even though he‚Äôs the only one left doing so.

After receiving help from the sole survivor, leads the few remaining in his group to Sanctuary and tries to recruit the sole survivor to help his cause while patrolling the streets to keep the remaining people (which he has no family/friend connections to) alive. 

Recognizes that the sole survivor has abilities beyond his own and tries to convince the SS to become the new general of the minutemen.

He doesn‚Äôt give up, mentally battles through things he‚Äôs witnessed that would crush most people, and continues to want to fight for something bigger to help all people of the commonwealth. He could‚Äôve bailed at anytime, leaving the group defenceless, but he stays with them.

""My friend and me went to the beach.""*My friend* went to the beach. *Me* went to the beach.

Of course this isn't correct. You would say:

""My friend and I went to the beach.""*My friend* went to the beach. *I* went to the beach.

So let's use this same principle with a different sentence, where you and your friend are the *objects*.

**Example (my friend and me)**:

""My teacher gave a test to my friend and I.""My teacher gave a test to *my friend*. My teacher gave a test to *I.*

That doesn't make sense, now does it? So instead, you would say:

""My teacher gave a test to my friend and me.""My teacher gave a test to *my friend*. My teacher gave a test to *me.*

&#x200B;

Edit: oh ok this blew up that's nice! This was just a reaction to a title I saw on a different Reddit post so that's cool. Thanks to the commentors who also showed the example. I struggled with phrasing the title and hoped the example in text would clear it up but reading comments is always fun.

Nothing in the world is worse than a customer who comes in right before closing, sees we're about to close and says something like ""We just want something small"" as if that makes it ok. 

It had been slow all night. Our sidework was done, silverware rolled and we were ready to head home. I was one of two servers there, the rest had left. A four top came in at ten to closing and we looked on, horrified, as they noted we closed in ten minutes but then justified it by saying ""We only want a few drinks and maybe an appetizer."" Even the hostess just stood there, looking at them like 'are you really going to stay?' Yup, they were. They settled into a booth, laughing and hooting it up, they had clearly already been drinking. 

Their server was my coworker, a woman who we called Mom. She was much older than the rest of us and the giver of advice and hugs when anyone needed it. She had worked there for years and didn't take shit. She purposely ignored the table for 9 minutes and then approached. 

They started ordering food, burgers, a steak - no appetizers. 

Server, cuts them off: Oh, sorry, but our kitchen closed about a minute ago. We aren't serving food anymore. 

They all look annoyed: What do you mean? We just sat down!! 

Server: I know but we closed at 11pm, as the hostess told you when you came in. It's past 11. 

Someone at the table: Can we get something from the bar? 

Server: Oh, sorry but the bar closed two minutes ago. We aren't serving drinks anymore. 

The table starts to yell at her: Why did the hostess seat us when she knew you were closing?? This is bull!

Server: Why did you sit when you knew we were closing in ten minutes? 

Their mouths dropped open at her gall. I too was shocked, watching this unfold, afraid she'd get in trouble. I thought they'd ask for the manager but they didn't, they got up and headed toward the door while loudly complaining about the injustice they had endured. They claimed they would never come back again and we'd lost their business. When they were gone, she looked at me and shrugged. She was the first person who taught me that sometimes the customer wasn't right and it was ok to call them out on it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/uz2abn/4_top_comes_in_at_ten_to_closing_think_its_ok/

For those of you that don't know, there are two hidden bosses in both areas of the Leviathan. They all give opulent keys if you have good RNG :)

**In pools there are:**  
\*The Assassin sniper, you'll know it has spawned when you see the white text ""a laser dot briefly passed over your ghost...."". It's in a hole, by the pillars.

\*An Abomination, you'll know it has spawned when you see the white text ""Dark ether gathers..."". It's in one of the door-ways, kinda on the same wall as the hole you find the assassin in. It's at the complete opposite of the wall where the entrance from Castellum is. There's a bunch of shrubbery in front of the door.

**In the Garden there are:**  
\*The beast-master, you'll know it has spawned when you see the white text ""The sound of beast sleeping can be heard..."". It's in a hole, inside sorta like an altar/half-pyramid. You can't miss it :)

\*The Sword and Shield, you'll know it has spawned when you see the white text ""A sword and shield clashes..."". It's inside the rock-wall right above where the the Ruins opulent chest spawns (kinda opposite where the beast-master spawned) you'll have to do a little jumping to get inside the chamber where they spawn.

\*The wording is roughly, I don't remember the EXACT phrasing but they are not similar at all, so you should be fine :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/uyxgn3/if_youre_getting_shot_at_with_a_purple_beam_by_a/

Has this happened to anyone else? How did you get it back?

Edit:
Really didn't expect this much feedback! Thank you so much for all the advice and awards. After some introspection I've determined my problem may be spending too much time scrolling in my downtime (instagram especially) and it's reduced my attention span to mulch!

If you're new to this thread and experiencing the same thing I am, here's a summary of some of the helpful advice I've gotten:
1. Less social media. 
2. If you've been reading the same things, try something new.
3. If you've found it hard to find new things to like, go back to your favourites. 
4. Try changing mediums (audiobooks, kindles, bionic reading etc.)
5. Stop feeling guilty about having downtime. You deserve it!
6. Slow progress is still progress. If you can only do a few pages a day, its fine!",https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/uyw4fz/has_anyone_ever_lost_the_ability_to_read/

While I've never been interested in kids, my two sisters have always adored and wanted them. By all accounts they would make fantastic mothers and yet, they feel they are forced to make this choice. There is absolutely no way to ensure their safety and health during pregnancy and now they can't even be sure that the children they bring into this world will be safe. 

My youngest sister (who is still in high school) confided in me this morning that our father has told her he doesn't care if Roe v. Wade is overturned because, ""it should be the state's right to choose anyways."" He's changed in the past couple years. My loving, compassionate father slowly became the type of man that blindly echoes the sentiments of republican talking heads to where he can't be bothered anymore that he's actively taking rights away from his only children. It makes me fucking sick. All he and my mother have ever wanted is for us to go off and have our own families so they can be grandparents and you know what? I hope they NEVER get to feel that joy. 

From the bottom of my fucking heart, I hope my parents never get to hold tiny grandchildren as their life is just beginning. I hope they never get to watch them grow and never get to tell them stories about my sisters and I when we were kids. I hope they never get to hear the stupid grandparent nicknames they've picked out for themselves come out of their grandchildren's mouths. I hope they live out the rest of their lives without knowing that happiness because they don't fucking deserve it anymore. 

I don't care anymore if I sound bitter because I have EVERY FUCKING RIGHT TO BE. I am bitter. I am a cold cruel bitch because I have been failed by the very same people who told me they loved me from my very first breath and then turned around and told me I don't deserve fundamental rights. At least they'll be able to buy guns though right? Maybe those will fill the hole in their hearts where their grandchildren should be. I'll make sure to remind them of that in a couple years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/uz0huw/our_republican_parents_dont_understand_the_long/

I‚Äôve lost 72 pounds since then.  But my mind doesn‚Äôt see it, you know?  And my pants are literally falling off of my ass.  So I went to buy some jeans.  The ones I‚Äôve bought at Old Nasty don‚Äôt hold their shape, and I can‚Äôt figure out what size I need. So I‚Äôm in the dressing room, and I try on a pair of 16‚Äôs.  Too baggy.  Must be a fluke, I think, but put on the 14‚Äôs the sales associate put in the room.  I slip them on, zip them up, and they fit!  It‚Äôs a miracle, I think.  I step outside to look in the mirror, and the sales associate says, ‚Äúso they fit nicely right now, but they‚Äôll stretch as you wear them.  Let me grab you the 12‚Äôs.‚Äù.  I just stare at her - the last time I wore a size 12 I was in them 9th grade, (I‚Äôm over 50 now).    So I try them on, and they zip,  they fit,  they‚Äôre the right size.  Size 12.  I know torrid vanity sizes, I know the stretch‚Ä¶but size 12? 

I cried.  Big, silent tears.  Because I just don‚Äôt see it.  I look in the mirror and see size 22.  I‚Äôve been size 18-22 for 35 years.    I don‚Äôt know when my mind is going to catch up and it‚Äôs hard, honestly hard.   I‚Äôve always been the biggest person in the room.  I‚Äôve always crossed my arms over my belly in the chair.  I‚Äôve always been afraid to sit in the folding chair and stood in the back row in pictures.   

It‚Äôs hard to have people tell you ‚Äúyou look great‚Äù.  It makes me feel bad,   Did I look so terrible before?    I smile and say thanks and inside I‚Äôm cringing.

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, but is there anybody else who feels this way?  Like I‚Äôm fake in this body?  Like the outside is a surprise?  Like I look down in the morning and when I see my toes I think, what the hell are those?   

I‚Äôve got more to lose.  I‚Äôm still seriously obese, according to the bullshit bmi charts.  And I‚Äôm going to keep going, but I just needed to vent.

Applicants are given a score based on a percentage of technical achievement as compared to our own, No race had ever achieved a score over 50% and the humans were no different. 

They scored quite well on industrious metrics and mathematics but were hampered by their lack of exotic metallurgy and material sciences, due to earth being a very young planet and lacking the gravity required to create some of the important exotic materials needed for faster than light tech and others. One area of technology they excelled at was shielding and weaponry. Apparently they had been fighting each other for so long that a sort of stalemate between weapons that could destroy almost anything and shields that could protect against almost anything had forced a peace stalemate.

The standard test for technology level was for the planet to present their best minds, they would be tested on theory as well as practical subjects. One of the modules was hyperdrive FTL technology which we already knew they didn't have due to the aforementioned inability to manufacture suitable materials caused by the lack of gravity. They did quite well in theory and did much better then expected in identifying the parts and purpose of most of the engine when tested. In the end it was decided that if they were to join they would need to be supplied the materials and experts to make this technology feasible for them. This was good news for the Orthalians as they were the only race that could supply such materials and experts, and this would put them in a very good position in trade as it had with other races, basically allowing them to demand whatever they would want in return.   

They filed their report and informed the humans that they had received a score of 22% and that the alliance would deliberate their application over the next 6 of their months. They did not seem pleased at the low score even though it was quite respectable among the other member races, They asked how long until they could retest to challenge the result. We informed them that all retests would have to be made on Kexldan the Orthalian home world and with their current space flight capability the journey would take over 23 years. They appeared to resign themselves to the process and their low score.

It was less than 2 of their months later when we received communication that they wished to retest. We again reiterated that all retest would have to be performed on Kexldan. They confirmed they understood, moments later a ship appeared in low orbit, Carrying a delegation from the human homeworld. At first we were shocked and assumed that another Race had sold a ship or passage to the humans but this ship was unlike anything we had seen before. With permission they landed and we held several meetings with the delegation. From that we discerned  that they had indeed built this ship in the intervening time since we last met and it was not only FTL capable but was faster than even our current tech by a order of magnitude. Baffled by this development we asked where they sourced the materials for this craft since they lacked the ability to make them.   

Turns out they did make them ...By producing them in the center of their own sun .... They built a factory for inside of their sun!... Apparently they built a mobile factory slapped enough shielding to make it ""survivable"" just to craft the elements they needed for the drive and flew it into their sun. They had also in the few hours they had spent with our schematics figured out enough for them to not only understand how to build it, but using their weapons and shield tech to improve it basically turned the ship into a FTL gun that shot itself across the galaxy almost instantaneously.

Well that was almost 200 years ago, and that brings us to today after a long wait we received our technology score in our bid to join the UTA (United Terran Alliance), we managed a respectable 13% now we wait for their decision.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/uz7rdp/humans_have_zero_chill_when_it_comes_to_technology/

This is from my hotel days, and I had just been promoted to assistant manager.  I was more on the hotel side of things, but at times, I did have to deal with certain things related to the spa.

To give you some background on the spa... it was a large facility with 30+ treatment rooms, a full salon, a steamroom, sauna, indoor whirlpool, an outdoor garden, and we also had a very large area with outdoor plunge pools.   This was the type of spa where, if you spent a certain amount of money, you would have access to the whole facility for the whole day.   

This was an ""adult"" facility... meaning: **no kids**.   To elaborate on what ""no kids"" means, it essentially meant, no one under 16.  If you are under 16, you cannot get a massage, facial, wax, or anything in the treatment room.  They also do not get access to the pools, or the steamroom/saunas/locker rooms.  They can get mani/pedis, or their hair done, but that's it.  The policy was, in part, for liability reasons - but also because, it's a spa.  people want serene, they want relaxing, and many of them are looking for a getaway from their OWN screaming children at home.  Therefore - **no kids**.

Now - most people understood this.  But every now and again, you had someone who just couldn't get it into their thick head.

> But what about my 9 year old, can I bring him to the pool?

No.

> But what about my baby?  I'm breastfeeding! 

No.

> Why??? It's just a baby!  The baby won't even *bother* anybody!

No.

>  Well that's just great, I was *planning* to bring all of my 7 grandchildren under the age of 10.  I *just* wanted to leave them all by the pool, by themselves, while I had a nice 90 minute massage, you're seriously going to tell me I cant do that?  Can't you JUST make an exception?

No.

> SO *YOU* MEAN, TO TELL *ME*, THAT I HAVE TO REARRANGE ALL *MY* PLANS, BECAUSE **YOU**...

you get the idea.

So one day, there's a member talking to one of my staff who wants to book hydrafacials for her family. and she was very vocal about the fact that this was going to be a mother-daughter day.  So, per policy, my staffmember had asked for their ages.

> My girls are 13 and 15.

She explains our age policy to them, and unfortunately, we cannot book Hydrafacials for them - but she would be happy to arrange something in the salon so that they can still have their wonderful spa day, etc.

This woman was not happy about that.

> Wha... what do you MEAN my daughters can't have hydrafacials?

>  We are MEMBERS!  

> This is not right!  I want to speak to your manager.

I just happened to be around when this was going on, so I take over the situation.

She basically does the same back and forth with me... I try to spin this in a positive way, basically reiterating our policy that while we are unable to accommodate X and y, we *can* do Z for you and your daughters.  We promise you'll have a wonderful time while you're here etc etc

None of this is working.  She insists that it's not right.

> Tell you what, I'll just call the call center, I'll tell them that the girls are both 16.  Just forget I ever said anything.

Ma'am, unfortunately I cannot have you do that.

> Why???  I don't understand!  They are so mature for their age!

I am not saying they aren't, however they are under the age limit for the spa treatments.

> But they're so mature for their age.  You would never even know she was 13.  If I told you she was an adult, you would have *never* known she was 13 if I just brought her in.

I get that, but you did tell us that your daughters are 13 and 15.  I would be more than happy to accommodate them with facials or massages when they are old enough to have those services, however I cannot accommodate that at this time.

> Don't you understand that teenage girls today are different now?  We didn't have Youtube.  These girls?  They have Youtube.  They learn all about skincare online, they KNOW skincare!  They know more about skincare than *I* do!

Ma'am, that does not change the fact that they are under the age of 16.  

((Nor does it change the fact that we don't recommend $350 hydrafacials on teenagers.... but I didn't go there with this person))

> You haven't met my daughter.  She's 13 and loves skincare.  She watches it on youtube.  She knows all about skincare.  It is so unfair that you would deprive her this experience!

Again.  She is 13.  I cannot book a $350 hydrafacial appointment, for a 13 year old.

... And then, she hit me with this one.

> **But she LOOKS like she's 25.**

AT this point, I was really, really tempted to point out how fucked up that argument is.  ""She's 13, but LOOKS 25!"" wouldn't exactly hold up in court, now would it?  

And let's fucking face it... she does not ""look"" 25.  There is no world where a 13 year old girl looks 25, especially if she knows so damn much about skincare.

She's telling me all the expensive products her daughter uses, how knowledgeable she is, it's so unfaaaair, this and that.

I remind her again... this is the policy.  We are sticking to the policy.

Now she's in tears.  

> This is crazy!  Don't you understand that they are going to be paying customers in just a few years??  They are teens *now*, but in a few years, they could be making a lot of money!  Why would you turn away future business?

> She LOOKS 25!  If I brought her in here, you would have NO IDEA she wasn't 25!  You would be SO impressed by how poised and mature she is!  

> Everyone who meets her is SO impressed by her and thinks she's 25!  

> Shame on you!  This is ageism!  SHAME ON YOU!

> **I AM A MEMBER!!!!**  And in just 5 years, **SHEEEEEEE** is going to be a member!   she'll be making enough money to come here on the weekends with her girlfriends and THIS is the type of business you turn away?  You are turning away future paying members!!  SHAME ON YOU!!!

> I mean she looks like she's 25!  SHould I have *lied* to you?  Is this a company that promotes *lying*???!!! Should I have *lied* that my daughter was 25 and you'd be none the wiser?

> She can't even use the pools?  Why, because you think teenagers are going to bother everyone?  They're not going to bother everyone!  This is shameful!  SHAME ON YOU!  Shame on this business!

Ma'am... I understand all of that, but I still cannot book a hydrafacial for a 13 year old.

> When I introduce people to her, they don't ask what school she goes to, they ask where she WORKS!  Where she went to COLLEGE!  You don't understand!  She's 13 and so mature, going on a grown adult!!!

Her tantrum gets to the point where she's attracting attention from other guests, and she's being asked to leave.

She then tried to call us and she reached our call center and gave them the same bullshit.  On a recorded line she's crying about how it was so wrong that we turned away ""future paying clients.""  

Note, this was in 2015 or thereabout, I highly doubt with the way things are doing that the then 13 year old, is now oozing with cash and spending her own money on expensive resort membership dues of $100k a year, to have spa days.  That's not exactly the state of Gen z right now, lady.

Anyway, that line always stuck out to me.  She's 13, but she *looks* 25.  One hell of an argument.  When I told my boss this story later that day, he said ""Oh, so is that how people get out of criminal charges?""  We had a good laugh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/uz8363/i_know_shes_13_but_she_looks_like_shes_25/

I'm telling it as I remember it so I don't have specific details but I'll provide as much as I can.

About 15 years ago a relatively large PC Manufacturer who I will not name for the sake of protecting identities offered Windows OS support in addition to hardware support for their PCs.

Well, in the State of Utah at the time, the predominant Area Code for phone numbers started 801. About 2-3 times a month, someone would somehow transpose the ""1-800"" portion of the support line and punch in ""1-801"" instead. This friend's phone # was identical to theirs, the difference being the toll free area code vs the local area code.

99% of the time he'd tell them ""yeah you need to dial the 800 #, you dialed 801"" they'd understand, apologize and hang up.

Well one older guy who hated himself, humanity, the neighbor's dog, Wednesdays, etc. called him and rather than accepting his error, just pressed ""redial"" on his phone. Each time he called he would become more agitated and escalated with insults, general douchebaggery and demanding help with his Operating System.

Finally after a few calls the friend had enough, recognized the # calling through and answered:  
\-""Hi, \[PC Manufacturer\] Support, how may I assist you?""

\-""YEAH, FIRST OF ALL SOME JACKASS KEPT HANGING UP ON ME AND WOULDN'T FIX MY COMPUTER, I WANT HIM FIRED!""

\-""Oh certainly, I'll personally make sure he does not work for \[PC Manufacturer\] as soon as this call is completed! What can I assist you with today?""

\-""OldManScreamingAtClouds.mp3""

* Side note: it's worth mentioning, this friend of a friend was a PC hobbyist and knew his way around PCs quite well, he just didn't want to do customer service for the company for free but in this moment he just snapped. The ""troubleshooting"" steps I'm about to list below **SHOULD NEVER BE PERFORMED BY ANYONE**.

""Okay, so I know what this issue is and there is a really easy way to resolve this. First things first, I need you to navigate to ""My Computer""... Okay now you should see something in there that says ""Local Disk"" and in parenthesis a capitalized ""C"". Please click on that. Once that loads up you'll want to locate a folder labeled ""Windows"" and inside that folder open another one labeled ""System32""........ Excellent, now this is a known issue that happens sometimes, do you see anything labeled ""Kernel"" in there?... You do!?... Okay, so if you have too many of those it will slow down your computer, just select all of those and delete them. It may prompt you for an administrator password, that's just your normal password to log into your computer... Okay, those are all gone? Perfect, now please restart your PC....\*click\*"".

He immediately turned off his cell phone and left it of for about 6 hours. When he turned it back on he had about 15 minutes of voicemails to listen to and I've been told they were quite humorous, a bit graphic and a couple got racist.

More context, I went to a gojira and deftones concert tonight and was able to get early entry tickets so I was front line in the standing section almost within arms reach of the stage.Show finishes and deftones throw some picks into the crowd, wasnt able to catch any but I notice one that didnt make it to the audience right in front of me so I got one of the security guys to grab it and give it to me. 

Turning to leave the venue now I notice probably the most disappointed looking guy right next, I assume he also saw the pick but I just acted quicker I guess. I see his arms on both forearms are the cover albums for deftones and honestly I'm not really sure what came over me but before I even thought everything out I just handed him the pick. He was absolutely stunned to say the least, it quickly turned into tears honestly couldn't hear most of what he said but something along the lines of it's his birthday hes turning 30 something and that this means so much to him. 

Still kinda stunned, honestly I want the pick I just kinda gave it away but seeing how happy he was is kinda worth it. Also definitely the first time I've made a grow man cry

**WIBTA for uninviting my brother because he is trying to ruin my father's funeral?** \- posted May 20, 2022

I will try to keep it short, but first of all, some context

I have three younger siblings, two brothers (Andrew and Ben), and one sister (Claire). When we were younger, my father discovered Ben was homosexual. He was enraged, and probably would have disowned Ben on the spot if it was not for the intervention of our mother. Dad and Ben never reconciled, and Dad did everything in his power to make Ben as uncomfortable as possible. Us siblings stayed close, but eventually Ben could not take the constant abuse anymore and moved out. Claire followed, but for career reasons. Andrew and I stayed in our hometown.

Dad died of COVID complications few days ago. As the eldest son of the family, it became my responsibility to prepare the funeral. He was a prominent member of the local community, so attendance will be high. Now we come to the main issue.

Ben wanted to give a eulogy, and sent me a draft of his speech. Unsurprisingly, the contents were not flattering, and I rejected him on the spot. He got really angry, and told me that this was his best chance to expose Dad's hypocrisy, especially since he had the image of a good family man. He wanted everyone to know how much abuse he suffered at the hands of our father.

Now, I love Ben unconditionally. He is my younger brother, and there are not a lot of things I would not do for him. However, this is one of them. It is simply not appropriate to speak ill of the dead at their own funeral, which is supposed to be a celebration of their life. For all his ugly, hideous flaws, Dad was a complicated person, and focusing the entire funeral on his relationship with one person is too much. There is also the fact that letting him do such a eulogy will probably cause a massive fallout in the community. Ben will not have the deal with the consequences, because he lives in another state, but Andrew and I will be left picking up the pieces.

Claire is on Ben's side for this one, while Andrew is on mine. I want to stress that I am not trying to cover for my father, or what he did to Ben. But there is a time and place for such things, and a funeral is not it.

Ben eventually backed down, but his husband has tipped me off that Ben is still preparing to cause trouble. I really really do not want to do this, but it seems to me that uninviting my brother from the funeral is the only choice. WIBTA if I did so?

For those asking why I would even want to honor such a horrible man in the first place: it's complicated.

Dad was a great father until the incident, which happened when I was in college. It's not easy being torn being two people you love, and even though I can say I did not hesitate to choose Ben, Dad was still the person I grew up admiring and loving. I'm still sorting my own feelings out, and trying to reconcile the loving father that raised me and my siblings with the man who threw away everything for his petty prejudices.

For those asking about the fallout:

It has to do with the town's local politics. That's all I'm willing to say

Going to do a last few clarifications here because people are making a lot of assumptions:

No. We did not cover up the abuse. All four of us siblings have been clear to our friends and family why we moved out of the family house, and my mother has also made it clear why she and my late father were estranged, even if we did not go out of way to air the family's dirty laundry. Ben has also made it clear that he does not resent any of us besides our father, and us falling out would just be what our Dad would have wanted.

I might have understated a bit when I referred to the eulogy draft as unflattering. It was vulgar, vile and definitely not appropriate for a funeral. Even if I had agreed with Ben's plan, there was no chance I would have approved the draft; the eulogy would have reflected badly on him, and not my father.

I am not going to ask Ben to keep the abuse a secret. He is free to tell anyone he likes, on Facebook, the local obituary etc. I just think that the funeral is not the appropriate time, and especially not through an eulogy

Verdict: YTA

[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uz0q3l/update_wibta_for_uninviting_my_brother_because_he/) \- posted May 27, 2022

Hello, it has been one of the longest weeks of my life, but the funeral has finally concluded. Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post. Some people sent me messages for an update, so here you go.

First of all, it would have been a mistake to rescind the invite to my brother, and thank you to the people who pointed out that I had no way of keeping him out of the church without asking security to throw him out. That would probably have been almost as bad, if not worse, than the eulogy. I had to deal with a lot of people during the funeral preparations, many of them unpleasant but influential, and really was not in the right state of mind to make decisions.

It was also wrong of me to try to deny Ben closure, though I do have to say that the comments accusing me of being complicit in or not having done enough to stop my brother's abuse were out of line. A singular post where I am actively trying to limit personal information is not a fair basis from which to extrapolate our family relationships, and it seems to me that many of the commenters have their own emotional baggage that they are trying to project onto my relationships.

I met up with my brother and his husband a few days after he gave me the eulogy. Thank you to those who suggested I ask about his motivations and provided alternate perspectives. We had a surprisingly brief talk. In short, Ben did not want us, his immediate family, to lionize our father. We agreed that Ben would come, but we would leave the eulogy to Dad's friends and we would hold a private wake for his immediate family only.

The funeral was mostly uneventful. A few questions were asked by the priest and my father's friends why none of his children or his wife were giving eulogies, but I just explained that we were leaving it for the wake. At the wake, we all got to say what we wanted to say. I will leave it at that.

Thanks to whoever suggested the after-funeral party. We went to our childhood home and had a great time. Due to COVID, we really hadn't had the chance to meet up much, and this was first time we've had in a long while to catch up.

After the funeral, we published an obituary with sections from each part of the family. It was tacitly worded, and choosing the right words was a pain, but Ben had fun with his section.

All in all, I think the matter was settled quite nicely. Thank you again for everyone who gave advice, and everyone who provided their kind words.

I pretended to be an agent messaging my dad asking if he was aware of his daughter's travel plans to Ukraine in late June to join the resistance and become a freedom fighter-- which is so funny bc I'm  a 100lb female and a girly girl who would never be able to fight in an army lol. Anyways I thought it was so absurd and totally unbelievable and that he'd laugh and know it was me, but he ended up contacting the FBI before even calling or speaking with me. Then I got in touch with him and he was livid, he asked if I was bored in life lol, and then he had to go tell the FBI agent that it was a misunderstanding and he was sorry for wasting their time. 

My agent name was John Burrows and I worded it so professionally. I told him that we were having trouble contacting him on his landline (he recently got rid of it) and that we received some concerning intelligence regarding his daughter and Ukraine.

TL; DR: Got a new number and pretended I was going to become a freedom fighter in Ukraine. He contacted the FBI before even speaking to me.

**********EDIT: I came here on the TIFU subreddit because this is where people talk about how they effed up. Posting here means I know I effed up. I'm aware. It was mean and it wasn't funny and it was stupid. I agree. That's why I'm here. If you can't accept people effing up then you probably should not be on the TIFU sub.

I've written my own patent and have a decent basic understanding of physics as well as knowledge of technological advancements. Rather than searching for patents with pictures that look like something from ufology I simply made an educated guess as to how ""some"" (some being a qualifying word) of these craft may work and then google searched a couple keywords followed by the word patent. Here's what I found in two minutes.

#  Magnetohydrodynamic propulsion apparatus 

[https://patents.google.com/patent/US3322374A/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3322374A/en)

&#x200B;

[Looks a bit like something from ufology don't it?](https://preview.redd.it/1eql1b9u22291.png?width=2320&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6bb7415ab2537f6222989f43a0f632f1fc0582)

Before I jump into this patent let's first define magnetohydrodynamic (MHD.) Here is the wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics)

 *the study of the magnetic properties and behaviour of* [*electrically conducting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conduction) [*fluids*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid)*. Examples of such magneto¬≠fluids include* [*plasmas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics))*,* [*liquid metals*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_metal)*,* [*salt water*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine)*, and* [*electrolytes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte)*. The word ""magneto¬≠hydro¬≠dynamics"" is derived from magneto- meaning* [*magnetic field*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field)*, hydro- meaning* [*water*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water)*, and dynamics meaning movement. The field of MHD was initiated by* [*Hannes Alfv√©n*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannes_Alfv%C3%A9n)*,*[*\[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#cite_note-1) *for which he received the* [*Nobel Prize*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize) *in Physics in 1970.*

*The fundamental concept behind MHD is that magnetic fields can* [*induce*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction) *currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself. The set of equations that describe MHD are a combination of the* [*Navier‚ÄìStokes equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) *of* [*fluid dynamics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics) *and* [*Maxwell‚Äôs equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%99s_equations) *of* [*electro¬≠magnetism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism)*. These* [*differential equations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) *must be solved* [*simultaneously*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_equation)*, either analytically or* [*numerically*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis)*.*

I want to point out that the word ""fluid"" here can be used to describe things that are not always though of as fluids. Basically, the mediums of space and air can also be considered ""fluids"" and the equations for these mediums are basically the same they just use a different constant. 

From the patent, "" The present invention relates in general to craft propelled by magnetohydrodynamic elfects and methods of propulsion and control thereof, and more particularly to heavier-than-air craft which are propelled by interaction of magnetic fields upon electrically conductive fluids such as plasma, surrounding the craft. "" So this patent is for an aircraft that uses MHD by utilizing a conductive plasma around it. 

MHD is not a new concept. It's about 80 years old. This patent is from the 60's. MHD is a subset of a larger concept called electromagnetically driven propulsion or EM propulsion. 

# 

# Electromagnetically driven propulsion

In addition to MHD there is also electrohydrodynamics (EHD) as well as ion drives. All of these are established concepts and technologies.    
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydrodynamics)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-propelled\_aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-propelled_aircraft)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion\_thruster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster)

We have demonstrated EM propulsion with current technology in the mediums of air, space and water already. These are not sci-fi theories. **They are known existing technology. However, they are not currently practical technology.** Understanding this is really the key insight. 

Why is EM propulsion not practical? The answer is current battery and gas technology isn't good enough (and probably never will be.) EM propulsion is very inefficient. In addition to being extremely wasteful, the weight of the fuel source barely makes the technology functional. It's demonstration is mostly perceived as little more than a novelty and waste of time. The ratio of energy necessary to the weight of the fuel source is so horrendous that it would never be practical using batteries or gas. This is because the energy sources of batteries and gas are chemical in nature and simply don't have enough energy density. They will always weigh too much and not get enough bang per ounce necessary to accomplish anything very extraordinary. This means the only way to implement a practical EM propulsion technology is with fusion energy. More specifically compact fusion energy. 

A compact fusion energy generator would be sufficient in powering a craft that uses EM propulsion to navigate the mediums of air, space and water with no visible conventional means of propulsion (propellers, wings, heat signatures in some cases.) So, such a technological feat can easily be applied to existing concepts and technology to build a craft that matches many (not all) of the unexplainable observables. In fact Lockheed Martin has a patent that covers such an aircraft.

Here's a decent article on the subject.  
[https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19652/lockheed-martin-now-has-a-patent-for-its-potentially-world-changing-fusion-reactor](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19652/lockheed-martin-now-has-a-patent-for-its-potentially-world-changing-fusion-reactor)

For those of you that think compact fusion is too advanced or far away, I'd like to point out that there are multiple companies working on it and claiming to be very close to net energy including Lockheed Martin. Advances in fusion have been accelerating and funding has been but a drop in the bucket over the decades, however, recently we've seen a rather large spike in fusion funding. It's definitely not 1000 years away. I could and have made entire posts dedicated to the topic of compact fusion feasibility and gross underfunding of it's research. I'd also like to point out it's the topic of at least a couple of the recently released declassified DIRDS. Specifically dense plasma focus device fusion approaches as well as aneutronic fusion approaches and specifically MHD as well as fusion powered ion drives.

# Fusion energy system and plasma propulsion aircraft to produce electricity from a controlled nuclear fusion reaction

[https://patents.google.com/patent/US20060102795A1/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20060102795A1/en)

This brings me to this patent from 2005. He also has a tubular design he patented in 2008.  
[https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090127383A1/en?inventor=Gary+Gochnour](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090127383A1/en?inventor=Gary+Gochnour)

His first patent describes a craft that uses either pB11 (aneutronic) or hydrogen fuel for the fusion process. It reads, "" Said craft, is immediately capable of space flight, use as a submersible craft, or use as an energy source in an artificial environment. Said craft is opaque, invisible within the visible spectrum, invisible to electromagnetic radiation, and absorbs radiation it produces. Said aircraft is capable of soundless flight. Said aircraft is capable of verticle ascent, descent and landing. Said aircraft can operate within earth radiation belts. Said aircraft is capable of speeds in excess of the fastest aerodynamic aircraft, said aircraft navigates within a particle field at a faster rate than conventional aerodyamic aircraft within the atmosphere. ""

His second patent is equally interesting. It reads, "" The invention relates to a plasma based aircraft possessing a magnetic field, and, a huge plasma vortex. Said craft is tubular in shape. Said craft has a vast array of capacitors. The craft has a proton accelerator, plasma guns, diversion devices. Said craft will approach the speed of light. Said craft obtains fuel direct from an atmosphere or a radiation produced atmosphere in space, at no cost. This craft can travel to a g k star for only the cost of construction of craft. This invention is comparable to the discovery of fire insofar as man's future is concerned...""

Okay, so have I stumbled onto something? This guys patents look interesting. Who is Gary Gochnour?

It appears there is a man by this name that was in the Army and referred to as a ""space explorer"" deceased 2015.

# This is turning into a rabbit hole

So, I started this post just to point out that MHD and compact fusion could be used to explain some UAP and use patents to help back it up. Then I found the last two patents and frankly I need more time to look into them and the author. Feel free to help me out. Odd stuff. 

&#x200B;

Back to the topic...

&#x200B;

# But this doesn't explain all observations

I'm aware that this hypothesis doesn't explain certain observations where the G forces should destroy the craft. Assuming those conclusions are not in error I have to say even EM propulsion with a compact fusion reactor falls short using known conventions. The best I can do is **speculate** that perhaps there is some unknown convention to explain what appears to be space time metric engineering. I have taken a deep dive into a topic that could potentially explain this known as Exotic Vacuum Objects or EVO's.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/tzibvc/potential\_science\_behind\_ufos\_ken\_shoulders\_hal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/tzibvc/potential_science_behind_ufos_ken_shoulders_hal/)

It's a significantly deep dive so to summarize, these are a plasma phenomena that a very well established and credentialed experimental physicist named Ken Shoulders identified and researched. He claimed that they were such dense collections of electrons that they were basically solids and that they were in such a high concentration they could be used as a kind of mini particle accelerator. He also claimed that they had odd gravity like effects and sometimes described them as a blackhole. 

"" There is a good chance common, small-sized EVOs can be classified as legitimate black holes; although I am sure Astronomers will object to this as much as they object to associating WIMPS with EVOs. Such associations lower the status of astronomy by being compared to mundane and ubiquitous examples. Still, when making a comparison between common, everyday EVOs, even obtained by sparking to a doorknob, the resemblance in a fundamental sense is striking. EVOs make both negative and positive charges of matter simply go away by removing the effect called charge and mass! If that is not the essence of a black hole, what is? A laboratory scale EVO is most likely a black hole in every real sense of the term. The size is an entirely different matter and should not be confused with the action produced. ""

Here is an old version of his website where he describes using them as a ""universals clutch.""  
[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513050518/http://www.svn.net/krscfs/An%20EVO%20Clutch%20and%20Microphone.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20080513050518/http://www.svn.net/krscfs/An%20EVO%20Clutch%20and%20Microphone.pdf)

 

I'm still trying to make sense of the whole EVO thing. I believe Ken was onto something. If he was then perhaps a craft utilizing EM propulsion technology and a compact fusion reactor would be able to turn the entire craft into an EVO?",https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/uz5sdl/i_heard_you_guys_like_ufo_patents_heres_what_the/

After all, sleepwalking isn‚Äôt a real emergency, right..?  

Below I‚Äôve copied and pasted the transcription of the call.  

\>>9-1-1 call.  Recorded: 12:01PM.

‚Äú9-1-1.  What‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúHello.  My name is Maggie Ellis and, um, I need help.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam, I will assist you.  What is the nature of your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my husband.  He ‚Äì there is something wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, ma‚Äôam, what exactly is the problem?  Is your husband hurt?  Is he threatening you?  Tell me everything that you can.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know how to explain it. My husband, Joe, he took a nap.  That‚Äôs not unusual.  Every day at 11:30AM, he takes his siesta then he wakes up promptly a half hour later.  He doesn‚Äôt even need an alarm.  Anyway that‚Äôs not important.  So Joe nods off as usual and I go to do the laundry and next thing I know, not five minutes later, there he is standing right behind me.  But the thing is it‚Äôs not him.  I mean, it is, but ‚Äì he‚Äôs sleepwalking.‚Äù

‚ÄúSleepwalking?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.  The man I‚Äôve been married to for 29 years is sleepwalking for the first time, well, ever.  And he‚Äôs staring at me, only he‚Äôs not.  More like staring through me.  You know, like not seeing me.  And his eyes‚Ä¶ they looked cloudy. Not blue.  My Joe, his eyes are blue like the ocean.  But these eyes were gray just like the sky just before a storm.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, are you asking what to do with someone who is sleepwalking?  If possible, I believe you should gently, very gently guide your husband back to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I know.  I did that.  I went to Joe and I said, ‚ÄòJoe, Sweetie, you‚Äôre sleeping.  I‚Äôm going to bring you back to bed.  Okay?‚Äù  But‚Ä¶ but he didn‚Äôt move.  He just stood there like he was made of stone.  And then, when I went to check his forehead to see if he was warm or sick‚Ä¶ he hit me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour husband struck you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, and hard.  Never‚Ä¶ NEVER in all our time together has he ever done this.  The man, he‚Äôs an accountant.  He‚Äôs practically a pacifist.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt fully understand what is happening, but just to be safe, I‚Äôm going to send someone to assist you.  Where is your husband now?‚Äù  


‚ÄúI ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know.  After he hit me, he just ‚Äì he just walked off and I just ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I called his doctor but he wasn‚Äôt in and so I called you.  Here, let me see if I can find him.  Joe!  Joe, can you hear me?‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt need you to go looking for him.  Please just stay where you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ oh my.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, what is happening?  Listen to me, I need you to go somewhere safe.  Where are you now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the kitchen‚Ä¶ what in God‚Äôs name has happened?  Every drawer has been opened‚Ä¶ Oh my‚Ä¶ Joe, what on earth have you done?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, please tell me what you see?  Ma‚Äôam?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all the drawers.  They‚Äôve been emptied.  And, and‚Ä¶ two of the knives from the butcher‚Äôs block are‚Ä¶ Oh no‚Ä¶ Joe‚Ä¶ Joe Sweetie, it‚Äôs Maggie, your wife.‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, please talk to me.  Is your husband there?‚Äù

‚ÄúJoe, please.  Please put down the knives.  You‚Äôre sleeping.  Joe!  Joe, wake up!‚Äù

\[UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAM\]

‚ÄúJoe, no!  Joe, stop!  Joe, wake up!  Please God wake up!‚Äù

\>>End of call.

Less than two seconds after the call went dead, I called Maggie back.  My training, I suppose, took over even as my heart went racing out of control and all the saliva in my mouth fled to God only knows where.  

Feeling powerless, I prayed ‚Äì I might have even spoken out loud ‚Äì ‚ÄúMaggie, pick up.  Please.‚Äù

But still I knew, I knew from the pitch and the tenor of her screams‚Ä¶ I know this might sounds strange, but it‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôve developed in part because of my brave, borderline reckless little four year old, Brian.  God do I love that boy so, but I swear not a week, not one fucking week, goes by when Bri-Bri doesn‚Äôt injure himself somehow, emulating his hero, that Brit survivalist, Bear Gryls, jumping off trees and rocks.  Over time, I‚Äôm not kidding, I‚Äôve learned my son‚Äôs screams so acutely I could tell the type of injury without even seeing it.  Cuts and scrapes sounded different than bumps and bruises.  And when he broke his arm last year, I knew even though I was I was out of view and a good forty feet away, I knew that injury was different; I could hear not just pain but panic in his voice, believing in his little heart he just might die.  He didn‚Äôt.

Hearing Maggie‚Äôs scream over the phone, shrill and desperate at first then crescendoing in this gurgle of blood, I knew, even as her phone continued to ring, I knew there was zero -- ZERO chance she would answer.

Less than ten minutes later, police arrived at Maggie and Joe Ellis‚Äôs house, finding Maggie still in the kitchen where he had left her.  The Medical Examiner would later count exactly twenty stab wounds, ten to the chest, another ten to the face.  Never before had the M.E. seen an attack that was so savage, but also so exacting.  As for Maggie‚Äôs killer, Joe himself was nowhere to be found.  The backdoor to the house was left wide open.  The knives from the butcher‚Äôs block gone.

Given what had happened, given that my face was white as a sheet, my hands trembling with fright (fright, also shame), given all that, my supervisor, David, volunteered to drive me home.  I told him no.  I might have even said something idiotic like this not being my first rodeo, trying to pretend my stomach wasn‚Äôt spinning cartwheels.  Looking back, I don‚Äôt know what the hell I was thinking.  Maybe I was trying to feign bravery and take back control.  Whatever the reason, I told myself, ‚ÄúJust take another call.  Move on and forget.  Move on and just help whoever calls next.

It took less a minute until the next call came in, but because we work in rotation, it didn‚Äôt come to my station but instead to Marissa Carmichael, my best friend at work and my role model for pretty much everything ‚Äì husband, children, work life balance ‚Äì Marissa had it all figured out.  

She always joked that the key to life was to make as many mistakes as possible, preferably when you‚Äôre still young.  Marissa swore that to truly learn, first you had to fail.  Marissa had experience at failing, having been kicked out of school when she was sixteen after getting knocked up by an abusive piece of shit who was at least 10 years older.  Later she‚Äôd lose the baby after getting pushed down the stairs, her swollen belly smacking hard against the slab tile floor.  Hitting literal rock bottom, Marissa, long story short, picked herself up, she buried her unborn child, got her GED and joined the Navy, returning years later to Greenville a changed woman.  

First thing she did when she got back to town was bait her abusive piece of shit ex into a fight where he threw the first punch and she threw the last.  I tell you Marissa was my hero.  Not just unflappable, but invulnerable.

Or so I thought.

The call came from the local hospital, St. Francis Memorial, which in itself, yeah, maybe that should have raised alarm bells, I mean considering that a hospital has their own security and obviously no one is better equipped to handle a medical emergency.

Below is that 911 call. 

\>>9-1-1 call.  Time: 12:06PM.

‚Äú9-1-1.  What is your emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúHelp!  This is Sharon Clarke, I am a RN in the ICU here at St. Francis.  We have a security guard down.  We need help.‚Äù

‚ÄúSharon, I hear you.  I will dispatch police right away.  But first, what exactly do you mean ‚Äúdown‚Äù?‚Äù

‚ÄúStabbed.  Dead.  I don‚Äôt know.  It was a patient.  She was asleep, then she just got up.  She took out her IV and just started wandering.  I tried to stop herself myself, but‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt.  It was ‚Äì it was like she wasn‚Äôt even there.  Like she was sleepwalking.  So I had security try to bring her back and, oh god‚Ä¶ she stabbed him.  Stabbed him with her own IV.  Oh Jesus, oh god, there‚Äôs another one.‚Äù

‚ÄúSharon, another what?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother patient.  Oh Jesus, he‚Äôs got blood on his gown.  And his eyes‚Ä¶ Oh god, he‚Äôs got a scalpel.  Help!  Somebody help!  Oh no, he‚Äôs walking toward me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSharon, I need you to listen‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh god no.  He‚Äôs not walking, he‚Äôs running!  Help!  Help me!‚Äù

‚ÄúSharon, run.  Run and get somewhere -- ‚Äù

\[UNINTELLIGIBLE SCREAM\]

\>> End of Call.

As quickly as the call ended, Marissa was sending police en route.  At the time, I had only heard one side of the call (I would read the transcript later), but already I knew somehow her call and mine were related.  I wanted so badly to talk to Marissa right then and there, to confirm the horrible churning in my gut, but I couldn‚Äôt because now my line was ringing as well.

And not just mine, but all five terminals all at once.  Marissa, Glenn, Rebecca, Luiz, all of our lines flashing red.

Now Greenville is not a large town by any stretch of the imagination.  In total there are maybe 6,000 residents, but still we have small town pride when it comes to emergency services, vowing we will always be there for a neighbor in need.

My hope is whoever reads this will be compassionate and not judge any of us too harshly for not putting two and two together sooner, but in our defense, none of us could believe what was happening.  Seemingly normal people from all walks of life, all of them residents of Greenville, were falling asleep, most taking a casual mid-afternoon nap, only to wake up minutes later changed, eyes milky white, and with an unquenchably thirst for violence.

\-- I have to go.  

I can hear someone‚Ä¶ something outside scratching at the door -- also my eyes are so heavy ‚Äì I have to stand.  I have to do something.  If I sit any more, I‚Äôll sleep.

So far it‚Äôs been 36 hours since that first call.  12 hours since I last heard from my husband and close to 48 hours since I last slept.

I don‚Äôt know what is causing this.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs viral or bacterial ‚Äì I just don‚Äôt know.  Nobody does.  It‚Äôs like a sickness, one that doesn‚Äôt have a name or a genesis or whatever, but the symptoms are clear.  

All I can do is try to stay awake just a little longer, one hour, one minute at a time.  And just hope somehow, someone, somewhere can please, please make this waking nightmare stop.

It makes no sense, but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about what is happening here in Greenville anywhere on the news, on the internet, nowhere‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like the whole town has been sucked into a black hole, but I swear to God, what is happening here is real.

God, I am so tired‚Ä¶

After I check the windows and the doors, I think I‚Äôm going to go take a cold shower.  And then more coffee.

With luck, I‚Äôll find the strength to keep writing.

I know this might sound cowardly, but the truth is there is a part of me that just wants to close my eyes.  A part of me that is ready to give up and accept my fate for doing the unthinkable.  For abandoning my post.  

That‚Äôs right, I did -- I abandoned my terminal.  I ran out on my co-workers and left calls unanswered when I was needed most.  When my town needed me.

But I didn‚Äôt have a choice, I HAD TO LEAVE.  

It took longer than maybe it should‚Äôve to accept that this wasn‚Äôt just some dream.  But the pathology was crystal clear.  You sleep, you change, you kill.  

And that‚Äôs when this thought washed over me, flooding every synapse of my brain, until all rational function was gone and all that was left was dread.

It wastes one less dish and it's more efficient that way. Just spoon to mouth.

Using just the spit in my mouth to wet it still gives it that signature oatmeal feel and texture - no milk or water necessary. But you also don't have to worry about it getting mushy or soggy either. You can feel it in real time and I'd even say it gives a bonus texture while you're chewing it up with some parts dry and some parts wet before you swallow it.

Save on having to clean a dish, I spend less money by not having to buy milk, and it doesn't get soggy. It's a win-win situation from start to end.",https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/uz386l/i_like_eating_dry_oatmeal_and_just_using_my_spit/

We met online but would travel to see each other pretty frequently. He is what some people may consider an internet celebrity, with around 1-2 mil subs on YouTube. Back when I was dating him was way before he had that many. He was still up and coming. Obviously things didn‚Äôt end up working out because the distance was not sustainable for the relationship and soon after I ended up meeting my current bf and I‚Äôm super happy with him. We‚Äôve been together long term, live together, share four pets, and have a pretty happy life. We have a normal relationship, we don‚Äôt really argue ever and have only a few times beyond meaningless bickering over small things. 

My ex and I are not on bad terms at all, we just kind of don‚Äôt interact, despite still following each other on twitter up until like two weeks ago (my only social media). 

A few months ago I posted a milestone picture on twitter about almost being done with law school and my ex replied to it congratulating me. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and just said thanks, but my boyfriend kept trying to talk to me about it and was telling me I should message him to see how he‚Äôs been and kept mentioning how many followers he has and how good that could be for me as a twitch streamer. I do stream on twitch but it's literally only for my family over seas, I am super shy and literally ban people from joining my stream if too many people join besides my family. I also have no desire to have a large following on there, or anywhere. At this point, my bf had never seen any of his content, and didn‚Äôt know the extent to his popularity (besides what he gathered from his twitter), or really who he was and just knew I had dated a guy with a YouTube channel when I was younger. I declined and said I would prefer to keep things silent but polite. He seemed super bummed. 

Fast forward a few weeks, my bf watches his (my ex's) content pretty much every day. I will admit that my ex is funny and his videos are really entertaining, but It‚Äôs getting increasingly weirder to me that my current bf is watching him at almost all times. He‚Äôs binged all of his content going back to like 2016 and even started saying this my ex says in his videos in like normal conversations, picking up his mannerisms and vernacular, etc. I‚Äôll come home from work and he‚Äôll just be watching my ex and laughing, which is fine if he just enjoys his channel but it didn‚Äôt stop there. My ex has unfollowed me on twitter and sent me a really long winded text that had a bunch of screenshots of my current bf non stop interacting with his tweets. Apparently my boyfriend has also messaged him/emailed him a bunch of times with edits he‚Äôs made of him, thumbnails for videos he‚Äôs spent hours photo shopping, video ideas, etc trying to get like, either a editing/production job with him or just be like associated with him. He even emailed my ex‚Äôs business email and tried to get my ex in his portfolio for website design. My ex was obviously super creeped out. This had been going on since the congratulations thing on twitter. He even started to do this to my ex's personal friends who have much smaller YouTube followings. I need to bring it up because I feel super uneasy by it but I‚Äôm unsure of what to do. Part of me thinks this is just innocent and my boyfriend wanted to make friends/thought my ex was cool and another part of me is concerned about this being a very disturbing sign of something...else. My bf is a little scatter brained and socially awkward but has never done anything so creepy before.  

Idk what to do, just gonna leave this open ended in hopes someone gives me some insightful input and a good approach to this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/uz2fm4/my27f_boyfriend32m_found_out_i_dated_a_celebrity/

A user submitted a ticket because the wifi signal near their desk appeared weak when they looked at their laptop. The actual performance was fine but they wanted to get ahead of the issue. Their desk was directly below a WAP and should have had full bars.

So, I grabbed my laptop and my cell phone and head on over to the user's desk. I imagine it's not gong to be long before other users in the area start complaining and I better be prepared to open a war room if needed.

So after discussing the issue with the user, I ask them to show me what's going on. They point to the wifi icon on their screen. Except it's not the wifi icon. They're not looking at one signal bar as they claimed. The wifi's working fine. They're looking at the volume icon, set at 10%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/uz08u6/whys_the_wifi_signal_so_weak/

The film was directed by Daniel Espinosa and had Jared Leto star as Dr. Micheal Morbius. The film is about a successful doctor who has cured many diseases, except for the disease he and his friend Milo have. Fortunately, he has found a cure for the disease, with the drawback being that he turns into a vampire and needs to consume blood to survive. For Morbius, this is a problem since he doesn‚Äôt want people to get hurt, however Milo sees it differently, and takes the cure to become a vampire. Because of this, the two of the friends soon become enemies. The film was very beautiful and there was a lot of impressive cinematography. The voice acting by all of the actors was perfect. My favourite part of the movie was when Morbius said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Morbin‚Äô time!‚Äù.",https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/uyvz52/morbius_film_review_for_my_homework/

**Since the election of President Joe Biden, a number of state legislators have proposed so-called ‚ÄúSecond Amendment sanctuary‚Äù legislation to declare their states immune from federal gun-safety laws they consider unconstitutional. Such bills aren‚Äôt an entirely new phenomenon; we saw an influx of proposals to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù states from gun control following the Sandy Hook Elementary mass shooting in 2013. What is new is the success of the movement. As of today, 13 states have enacted Second Amendment sanctuary laws.**

**These laws are dangerous and unconstitutional. They circumvent the democratic system and the role of courts in determining the constitutionality of laws, while confusing citizens into thinking they are immune and that certain gun laws do not apply to them.** 

>**""They‚Äôre really overstepping their role in the constitutional system and undermining the rule of law,"" [said](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/investigations/2020/02/14/how-kentucky-counties-adopted-second-amendment-resolutions-oppose-gun-laws/4736639002/) Kathi Crowe, legislative lead volunteer for gun violence-prevention group Moms Demand Action‚Äôs Kentucky chapter. ‚ÄúI think a lot of this is to intimidate parents, survivors and people who want protection from gun violence.‚Äù**

##ALABAMA

On April 13, 2022, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed [Senate Bill 2](https://legiscan.com/AL/text/SB2/id/2425813), also known as the Alabama Second Amendment Protection Act, into law. It reads, in part:

>The State of Alabama hereby declares that any and all federal acts, laws, orders, rules, and regulations related to firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition are a direct infringement on the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America and therefore are unconstitutional

‚ÄúIn Alabama, we value our rights so much so, our motto is 'We dare defend our rights.' As governor, I am proud to sign the Alabama Second Amendment Protection Act into law to ensure our constitutional right to bear arms is not infringed on by federal overreach,‚Äù Ivey [said](https://abc3340.com/news/local/gov-kay-ivey-signs-alabama-second-amendment-protection-act-gun-rights-guns-safety-constitutional-carru-bear-arms-federal-overreach-governor-legislation-senate-bill-2-gerald-allen-) in a statement. ‚ÄúAlabamians can be confident I am taking a stand for their Second Amendment rights, and this legislation will further safeguard their ability to protect their families and homes.‚Äù

##ALASKA

Alaska was one of the first states to enact a Second Amendment sanctuary-style bill. Republican Gov. Sean Parnell signed the Alaska Firearms Freedom Act into law in 2010 and another bill expanding its reach in 2013.

[House Bill 69](http://www.akleg.gov/basis/Bill/Detail/28?Root=HB%20%2069) (2013) reads in part:

>A personal firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition that is possessed in this state or manufactured commercially or privately in this state and that remains in the state is not subject to federal law or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of the United States Congress to regulate interstate commerce as those items have not traveled in interstate commerce‚Ä¶ 

>(g) The attorney general shall, under the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or art. I, sec. 19, Constitution of the State of Alaska, file legal action necessary to prevent the implementation of a federal statute, regulation, rule, or order that violates the rights of a resident of the state. 

##ARIZONA

Republican Gov. Doug Ducey [signed](https://www.azmirror.com/blog/gun-control-advocates-urge-ducey-to-veto-gun-sanctuary-bill/) [HB 2111](https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2111/id/2359139/Arizona-2021-HB2111-Chaptered.html) into law last year, claiming it is needed to protect gun rights from the Biden administration.

>Pursuant to the sovereign authority of this state and Article II, Section 3, Constitution of Arizona, this state and all political subdivisions of this state are prohibited from using any personnel or financial resources to enforce, administer or cooperate with any act, law, treaty, order, rule or regulation of the united states government that is inconsistent with any law of this state regarding the regulation of firearms.

##IDAHO

Republican Gov. C.L. ‚ÄúButch‚Äù Otter signed [Senate Bill 1332](https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2014/legislation/S1332.pdf) into law in 2014.

>It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to protect Idaho law enforcement officers from being directed, through federal executive orders, agency orders, statutes, laws, rules, or regulations enacted or promulgated on or after the effective date of this act, to violate their oath of office and Idaho citizens‚Äô rights under Section 11, Article 1, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho. This Idaho constitutional provision disallows confiscation of firearms except those actually used in the commission of a felony, and disallows other restrictions on a citizen‚Äôs lawful right to own firearms and ammunition.

‚ÄúI signed it into law as a way of protecting our Second Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and indemnifying Idaho law enforcement officials from enforcing federal firearms or ammunition restrictions that conflict with Section 11, Article I of the Idaho Constitution,‚Äù Otter [said](https://www.idahostatejournal.com/members/nullifying-federal-gun-laws-in-idaho-gov-butch-otter-signs-senate-bill-1332-into-law/article_97429e26-b3f0-11e3-8581-001a4bcf887a.html#:~:text='Butch'%20Otter%20signs%20Senate%20Bill%201332%20into%20law,-By%20Debbie%20Bryce&text=After%20passing%20a%20law%20that,gun%20laws%20in%20the%20state.).

##KANSAS

Republican Gov. Sam Brownback signed [Senate Bill 102](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/measures/documents/sb102_enrolled.pdf) into law in 2013.

>A personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately and owned in Kansas and that remains within the borders of Kansas is not subject to any federal law, treaty, federal regulation, or federal executive action, including any federal firearm or ammunition registration program, under the authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce‚Ä¶

>It is unlawful for any official, agent or employee of the government of the United States, or employee of a corporation providing services to the government of the United States to enforce or attempt to enforce any act, law, treaty, order, rule or regulation of the government of the United States regarding a firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately and owned in the state of Kansas and that remains within the borders of Kansas.

##MISSOURI

Republican Gov. Mike Parsons signed [House Bill 85](https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills211/sumpdf/HB0085T.pdf), known as the Second Amendment Preservation Act, into law last year.

>(2) Declares that all federal acts, laws, executive orders, administrative orders, court orders, rules, and regulations, whether past, present, or future, that infringe on the people's right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 23 of the
Missouri Constitution must be invalid in this state, including those that impose a tax, levy, fee, or stamp on these items as specified in the bill; require the registration or tracking of these items or their owners; prohibit the possession, ownership, use, or transfer of a firearm; or order the confiscation of these items‚Ä¶

>Specifies that any entity or person who knowingly acts under the color of any federal or state law to deprive a Missouri citizen of the rights or privileges ensured by the federal and state constitutions to keep and bear arms must be liable to the injured party for redress, including monetary damages in the amount of $50,000 per occurrence and injunctive relief. 

The purpose of this is to stand up to the federal government,‚Äù Parson [said](https://www.thetrace.org/2021/08/missouri-second-amendment-sanctuary-law-gun-crime/). ‚ÄúTrust me, the states are the firewall to the federal government. If we haven‚Äôt learned that in the last 14 months, I don‚Äôt know when we‚Äôre ever gonna.‚Äù 

Members of the community weren‚Äôt so sure the legislation would work as Parson intended:

>City and county officials have said that the law may stop police from testifying against gun offenders in federal court, tapping federal resources to solve local shootings, or working with federal agents to disrupt firearms trafficking. The Missouri Highway Patrol said it plans to quit participating in federal task forces focused on weapons violations. In the city of O‚ÄôFallon, the prospect of a fine for seizing weapons during arrests or to protect a resident from suicide so appalled the police chief that he chose to resign rather than grapple with a ‚Äúflood of weaponized litigation.‚Äù 

Both local [counties](https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/missouri-supreme-court-reverses-judges-2nd-amendment-preservation-act-ruling) and the [Justice Department](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/17/1081379148/department-of-justice-sues-missouri-over-gun-rights-law) have filed suit against the state for enacting the law.

##MONTANA

Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte [signed](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-governor-signs-bill-to-protect-second-amendment-from-federal-gun-restrictions) [House Bill 258](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB258/id/2358897) into law last year: 

> A peace officer, state employee, or employee of a political subdivision is prohibited from enforcing, assisting in the enforcement of, or otherwise cooperating in the enforcement of a federal ban on firearms, magazines, or ammunition and is also prohibited from participating in any federal enforcement action implementing a federal ban on firearms, magazines, or ammunition.

##NEBRASKA

Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts [signed](https://governor.nebraska.gov/press/gov-ricketts-designates-nebraska-%E2%80%9Csecond-amendment-sanctuary-state%E2%80%9D) a proclamation designating Nebraska as a ‚ÄúSecond Amendment Sanctuary State.‚Äù

>Nebraska will stand up against federal overreach and attempts to regulate gun ownership and use in the Good Life; and

>The White House and U.S. Congress have announced their intention to pursue measures that would infringe on the right to keep and bear arms; and

>A growing number of counties in Nebraska have declared themselves as ‚ÄòSecond Amendment Sanctuary‚Äô counties; and

>Nebraska will continue to take any necessary step to defend our right to keep and bear arms..

>Now, therefore, I Pete Ricketts, Governor of the State of Nebraska, do hereby proclaim the State of Nebraska is a Second Amendment Sanctuary State.

##NORTH DAKOTA

Republican Gov. Doug Burgum [signed](https://www.governor.nd.gov/news/burgum-designates-north-dakota-second-amendment-sanctuary-state-signs-bills-protecting-gun) House Bill [1383](https://www.ndlegis.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-0822-06000.pdf) into law last year.

>An agency or political subdivision of the state and a law enforcement officer or individual employed by an agency or political subdivision of the state may not provide assistance to a federal agency or official or act independently with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or enforcement of a violation of a federal statute, order, rule, or regulation purporting to regulate a firearm, firearm accessory, or firearm ammunition enacted after January 1, 2021, if the federal statute, order, rule, or regulation is more restrictive than state law

##OKLAHOMA

Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed [Senate Bill 631](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB631/id/2377910/Oklahoma-2021-SB631-Enrolled.pdf) into law last year.

>The State Legislature hereby occupies and preempts the entire field of legislation by any agency of this state or any political subdivision in this state to infringe upon the rights of a citizen of the State of Oklahoma, the unalienable right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.

>B. Any federal, state, county or municipal act, law, executive order, administrative order, court order, rule, policy or regulation ordering the buy-back, confiscation or surrender of firearms, firearm accessories or ammunition from law-abiding citizens of this state shall be considered an infringement on the rights of citizens to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Article II, Section 26 of the Constitution of Oklahoma.

‚ÄúMonday was a great day in our state‚Äôs history, since we officially became a Second Amendment Sanctuary State,‚Äù Senator Warren Hamilton, who authored the bill, [said](https://oksenate.gov/press-releases/governor-makes-oklahoma-second-amendment-sanctuary-state-signing-senate-bill-631-law). ‚ÄúThis is especially pertinent now given the attacks on our Second Amendment rights by the Biden administration.

##TENNESSEE

Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed [Senate Bill 1335](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB0928/id/2409954/Tennessee-2021-HB0928-Chaptered.pdf) into law last year.

>Pursuant to the sovereign authority of this state, a law, treaty, executive order, rule, or regulation of the United States government that has been found by the supreme court of the United States or the Tennessee supreme court to violate Article I, ¬ß 26 of the Constitution of Tennessee or the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is null, void, and unenforceable in this state. 

##TEXAS

Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed [House Bill 2622](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/html/HB02622F.htm) into law last year.

>Notwithstanding any other law, an agency of this state,  a political subdivision of this state, or a law enforcement officer  or other person employed by an agency of this state or a political  subdivision of this state may not contract with or in any other  manner provide assistance to a federal agency or official with
 respect to the enforcement of a federal statute, order, rule, or regulation that:
 
>(1)  imposes a prohibition, restriction, or other regulation that does not exist under the laws of this state; and‚Ä¶relates to:

>(A)  a registry requirement for a firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition;
>(B)  a requirement that an owner of a firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition possess a license as a condition of owning, possessing, or carrying the firearm, firearm accessory, or ammunition;
>(C)  a requirement that a background check be conducted for the private sale or transfer of a firearm, a firearm accessory, or ammunition;

""Politicians from the federal level to the local level have threatened to take guns from law-abiding citizens ‚Äî but we will not let that happen in Texas,"" [said](https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-signs-second-amendment-legislation-into-law-2021) Governor Abbott. ""Texas will always be the leader in defending the Second Amendment, which is why we built a barrier around gun rights this session.

##WYOMING

Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed [House Bill 95](https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2010/HB0095) into law in March 2022.

>A personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in Wyoming and that remains exclusively within the borders of Wyoming is not subject to federal law, federal taxation or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce‚Ä¶The authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce in basic materials does not include authority to regulate firearms, firearm accessories and ammunition made within Wyoming borders from those materials. 

‚ÄúWe stand strong together to hold ourselves and our officers accountable to not enforce, administer or cooperate with any unconstitutional acts,‚Äù [said](https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/second-amendment-protection-act-signed-with-support-of-law-enforcement/article_c13f3d46-1adb-5788-ae50-2456bc4c9e1c.html) Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police Executive Board President and Rock Springs Police Chief Dwane Pacheco. ‚ÄúThis is one of the most important legislative actions on a personal and professional level that I have seen in my career.‚Äù

#COUNTIES

**The Second Amendment Sanctuary movement has infiltrated not just state legislatures, but gained the support of county governments and small town sheriffs across the country who refuse to enforce any gun laws they disagree with.**

**Many of these law enforcement officials align themselves with the movement of ‚Äú[constitutional sheriffs](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/the-renegade-sheriffs),‚Äù who believe their position should grant them the authority to determine the constitutionality of state and local laws, even if that means defying the federal government.**

>**The idea of a constitutional sheriff emerged in the nineteen-seventies, in California. It was first proposed by William Potter Gale, who had been an aide to General Douglas MacArthur. According to Daniel Levitas‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúThe Terrorist Next Door,‚Äù Gale embraced a belief system called Christian Identity, and, as a self-styled minister, preached that the Constitution was a divinely inspired document intended to elevate whites above Jews and racial minorities. From his Ministry of Christ Church, outside Yosemite National Park, where he sermonized in front of a giant Confederate flag, Gale produced a newsletter, ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù its name reflecting his ideology and his fondness for unnecessary capitalization.**

**According to one [gun rights group](https://sanctuarycounties.com/2021/09/29/1965-american-counties-are-now-second-amendment-sanctuaries/) ‚Äú1,965 counties in the United States are covered by either state or county level 2A Sanctuary resolutions, ordinances, or laws‚Äù (as of September 2021).**

Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams gained national attention for his [refusal](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/31/us/colorado-red-flag-gun-law/index.html) to enforce the red flag law, saying he is willing to be arrested for his beliefs.
