A colposcopy is a procedure of the cervix. A colonoscopy is a procedure of the lower GI tract**

I’ve had a few abnormal paps over the past few years. All 3 low grade dysplasia. I was young so they waited to see if it would clear but now that I’m 27, they want me to get a colposcopy. 

I’ve traveled around the country a lot for work (I’m in the US) so I’ve had different OBGYNs for each yearly PAP. I’ve probably seen 4 obgyns in my life. I’ve also had 3 IUDs put in by 3 different OBGYNs. The first one I was 19 and it hurt like hell. The second I was 22 and it also hurt. 

The 3rd IUD was my first male OBGYN and I looked at him and said “I can’t take the pain of these anymore” and he said “oh honey, I don’t put those in without 2 hydrocodone, cervix softener, and Xanax beforehand. I’ll have you feeling real good, I promise!” And you know what? I DIDN’T FEEL A FUCKING THING. I loved him so much, I was so sad to leave him behind and move across the country. 

I just had my first gynecologist appointment with a doctor who is HIGHLY rated in the hospital system that I had to wait 3 months to get in because her reviews are so good. 

So today I see her and she recommends I get the colposcopy after reviewing my medical records from my various GYNs. She offers to do it to me TODAY. I said “Um no, I haven’t taken anything for pain and I don’t have anyone to drive me”

So this witch proceeds to tell me colposcopies don’t hurt and I just need to take Motrin beforehand (so…how was I supposed to do the procedure today in the office with if I need to take Motrin beforehand?). I put my foot down and said “no, that’s not what I’ve heard from my mother and my friends. I’ve only heard that this procedure is nothing but pain. I need something more than OTC for this” 

And she was like “oh honey, the biopsies are like 1/4th of a tic-tac, it’s nothing to worry about” and I said “it’s a piece of tissue being cut out of a sensitive area, I don’t believe you” and she just stared at me in silence (couldn’t tell if her mouth was open because of the mask). 

She said “I honestly don’t want you to worry about this, it’s a very simple procedure and it’s only period-like cramping”

Then I said “the cervix feels pain. I’ve had 3 IUDs put in and the first 2 were hell and incapacitated me for the rest of the day. My previous doc did the 3rd and I was provided proper pain management before the procedure and I didn’t feel any pain.” 

She was like “that’s really not standard procedure for IUDs, besides this hurts waaay less than an IUD.”  Then she scoffed and said “what did he give you?” and I know she was just WAITING for me to say “prescription-strength Tylenol” or something dumb so she could invalidate me. 

I said “He gave me 2 hydrocodone and Xanax. I know it’s not your standard protocol, it should be and it was with my other doctor and frankly I’d rather have him do this procedure over you but he’s 700 miles away, but I’m not getting this done without something more than OTC painkillers.” 

(Awkward silence)

“…..well I don’t normally do this, but I guess I can give you something” And she caved and gave me a script for hydrocodone to take before the procedure. 

LADIES: DON’T LET THESE BARBARIC ASSHOLES WALK ALL OVER YOU. YOU ARE WORTHY OF NOT FEELING PAIN AND THESE IDIOTS NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP AND GIVE US PAIN MEDICINE. 

Do whatever you have to. Make up a fake story (borrow mine!) [edit: don't lie about drug and procedure history], do research, print stuff and bring it with you. Don’t leave the office until they give you pain medicine. And if they say no? “Please note in my chart that you have denied my request for pain management” and if that doesn’t work, find another doctor.

**EDIT: To all you people talking about drug abuse: I got prescribed one (1) 5mg hydrocodone to take in office and have someone drive me. ONE. Stop acting like I was seeking drugs for a drug abuse habit.**

**EDIT: Some of you don't seem to understand what this procedure entails and why over the counter medicine doesn't cut it for most women. The colposcopy + biopsy procedure literally cuts chunks out of your cervix. Read through this fun Buzzfeed article with an interview with an OBGYN to learn more: https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaemanuel/cervical-biopsy-colposcopy-tiktok**

**In the artcle: ""Finally, I wanted to know more about the future of pain management during gynecological procedures, and whether this was something being discussed in the medical world. ""We are nowhere near where we need to be in terms of providing a range of pain control options for people undergoing gynecologic procedures, but I will say that these conversations are happening in the medical community more frequently than they used to,"" Dr. Horvath said. ""Just like with so many other areas of medicine, there are racial, ethnic, age, and class disparities in who is offered certain pain control options. We have a long way to go in the process of reckoning with all the ways we perpetuate oppression in the medical care system. It's always OK to ask your healthcare provider about pain control options,"" she said. ""A good physician, midwife, or advanced practice clinician will listen to you and work with you to come up with a plan that addresses your needs. If you feel like they are dismissing your concerns, trust your gut and get a second opinion.""""**

**Edit: Someone made a new account after reading this post just to call me a ""pathetic junkie whore"". That's just not true. I'm not a pathetic junkie! (ba-dum tsss)**

**some examples of people who have taken the time to DM me harassing messages because of this post:**

u/billyfucker: “No proper doctor is going to say I'm giving you 2 hydrocodone and 1 Xanax to have you feeling really good. Seems like you enjoyed those pills too much and didn't listen to a professionals opinion. You even said yourself she is highly reviewed. I'd be careful with those pills if I were you” 

 u/therealseabass: “Did you want someone to pat you on the back? No doctors cares about this FYI. It’s a matter of ease in avoiding narcotics when they are not needed. And news flash- they are not needed. You are a snowflake. And remember that you are speaking out on a subreddit full of other mentally Ill losers. No wonder you get the gratification you’re looking for. Absolutely pathetic.” 

u/futbol_medic: “Yes, stop taking medical advice from someone that has dedicated their life to studying it. My vasectomy hurt like a bitch.

You should do the same.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v2lbwd/i_just_demanded_that_my_doctor_provide_me_with/

Never heard of this sub so sorry if I broke any rules within the post.

This isn’t necessarily my proudest moment but I am tired of being the outcast.

My (32f) husband “Pete” (34m) comes from a family where the women are all bakers. I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.

His SIL “Kay” (39) is the one who is “known” for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they’re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because “they are not Kay’s”.  Yes, I’ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  

To be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete’s family agrees.

We had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. 

We got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they’re in car and I’ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay’s.

After we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay’s.  She didn’t notice at first and then asked if they weren’t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.

Kay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That’s when I said, “Oh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.”

Her husband said he hadn’t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said “yeah, they were okay.”  Kay didn’t say anything the rest of the night.

Pete thought it was funny (he didn’t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay’s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I’m just mad that Kay is a better baker.  But Pete said it’s ridiculous the family, including Kay, puts down my baking when they won’t even try it all because I’m not Kay. 

ETA:  We aren’t the only two who bring desserts, just the ones who tend to bake cake more than others.  Everyone else’s desserts get eaten to some degree except mine.

Edit 2:  If it’s not clear, “everyone” includes Kay.  She has often tried to “teach” me techniques that I either already knew or were completely wrong.  So she wasn’t like an innocent that got caught in the line of fire or something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/v2qnt1/inlaws_constantly_berate_my_baking_skills_in/

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/v1l4pp/pretty_sure_im_in_love_with_my_roommate_and_i/) post from r/offmychest by [u/trashboat000004](https://www.reddit.com/user/trashboat000004/).

This’ll be a pretty long one. No one’s obligated to respond by the way, I just have nowhere else to dump all these ridiculous feelings lol.

On new year’s 2016 I (23M) met my roommate (25F) through a friend of a friend. We got along pretty well and I admired how confident she was, and the fact that she spoke four languages fluently. She told me she thought I was funny and we had a lot in common. Basic shit. We went home and figured we’d probably never see each other again, mainly because this was in CA, where I was only visiting. I lived in New York.

In summer of 2016 while visiting CA again, I got invited to a group watch/viewing party thing for Stranger Things with the same group of friends. Sure enough, she was there. It was only supposed to be a couple hours long, but a few of us decided to stay and binge because we really liked the show. Her and I were 2 of those people. She remembered who I was and I was freaking thrilled. It’s crazy because I genuinely wasn’t into her romantically right away, I just really wanted to spend time with her. We ended up having a great time and exchanged numbers, etc etc. From then on we were pretty good friends, despite the distance.

Our relationship was unique compared to any others I’ve had, right off the bat. It was such a haphazard mix of barely knowing anything about each other while also knowing really deep and personal stuff about each other that no one else knew. I’m sure this was partly because of the long distance, but still I’d say we were pretty close. By the end of 2017 I considered her one of my best friends.

In 2019 I got a job and I was allowed the option to relocate. One of the possible locations was a city in socal, and I took it. You can obviously see where this is going. We decided to live together and everything got a thousand times better. I can’t even describe it but to no one’s surprise, we made great roommates.

Quarantine affected her job pretty heavily since she worked in fashion. She ended up staying home a lot and I was able to do my job from home. Her family is small and consists of only a few people, and I don’t really have any living family left, so this fortunately made the whole COVID thing a lot less scary. This lead to us spending tons of time together just talking and enjoying each other’s presence, even learning some new languages together (we’re both aspiring polyglots).

Last year she brought up how she’d love to live in different countries for a few years at a time. She asked me how I felt about moving, and I told her I would go anywhere in the world with her if she asked me to. I think we both assumed I said this because I, like her, love experiencing different cultures and languages in different places. But in retrospect I think I was already in love with her.

It’s coming up on one year we’ve been living in \[redacted country\] (don’t want to get too specific) and it’s been refreshing and scary for many reasons. But mainly this has been the hardest year of my life because I’m always so close to her. We don’t have many strict physical boundaries (this we’ve mutually agreed upon & are comfortable with), so she’ll walk in & use the bathroom while I’m in the shower, she’ll lay on me and fall asleep if we’re both on the couch or even in bed, etc. (Though we obviously have separate rooms). This has never been a problem and we both completely trust each other.

But recently, having realized how I feel, it makes me really nervous. I’m so afraid she can hear my heartbeat when she’s near me and it’s so fucking embarrassing dear god. Even typing this is so embarrassing I can’t believe I made a throwaway account just to say all this mushy shit to a bunch of strangers. But thank you for reading, if you’ve gotten this far.

She still works in fashion, so historically I’ve let her dress me up and practice on me because I don’t mind. And honestly, she has great taste. She’s been making jokes like “I’ve always wanted to dress up my boyfriend,” and just jokingly referring to me in that way. I’m so dumbstruck I honestly can’t remember if she’s always made jokes like that every so often and it only stands out to me now because of how I feel, or if this is new. But either way I’m starting to worry that she’s able to pick up on my shift in energy when she gets close to me. I just can’t help it.

Last night we were messing around with her extra makeup palettes (yes, I let her practice makeup on me. Yes, I know.) I was doing a terrible job putting makeup on her because I never use it, and she was comparing shades of eyeshadow on me. Our faces were incredibly close and I kept fucking up and dropping things and stuttering, which aren’t the usual for me. She definitely noticed. I had COVID last month and have been having mild lasting issues from it, so I just keep blaming everything on that, including ‘heart palpitations’. It’s a perfect cover for now but it’s going to wear off. I feel like I’m super obvious and she somehow already knows.

I just can’t express how completely in over my head I am. Everything she talks about, the things she enjoys, the way she laughs. I could listen to her talk forever about anything. When she falls asleep, she snores. She has no idea. I think it’s cute but I don’t want to embarrass her by telling her. But when she dozes off and leans on me all I can think about is that this is all I want out of life. Dramatic, I know. I am truly in too deep.

As you can probably conclude, I am a fucking mess. I’m so worried about ruining everything it’s tearing me apart. Even now I keep writing things like “it’s okay if she doesn’t feel the same, I can live with that” and erasing it because it just isn’t true. She’s currently asleep next to me and looking at her… It just makes me think I’ll be devastated if that’s the case. And then what? Six years of friendship. She is my best friend. I just don’t know what to do.

She also uses reddit like I do. And she checks this page a lot. If she sees this she’ll absolutely know it’s me.

Anyway… This post is long enough. Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I hope you’re having a peaceful day/night. :)

Update: Holy fucking Christ on earth. To everyone who messaged me and left comments, thank you infinitely. There are simply too many for me to reply to them all - I never expected to get so much support. I literally posted this in a haze before going to sleep. I wasn’t even going to log back into this account. Everyone sharing their similar stories is completely melting me to my core.

I’m gonna clarify a couple things:

\-A lot of people have asked if we’ve dated anyone in the past 6 years and the answer is yes, but nothing serious for either of us. We have always been each other’s wingman. Back in CA, we each had a few dates here and there. A few that came home even. But after quarantine it stopped, and it hasn’t picked up again since. Neither of us have been seeing anyone or even talked about going out/using dating apps etc since early 2020.

\-At the mention of “if you hadn’t stated your genders I would’ve thought this was sapphic/etc” because lesbians and bisexuals tend to pine in this way - well you’re still 100% correct, because we are both bisexual. Lol.

You’ve all convinced me that this is worth the risk. I’m going to tell her. I’m currently at work but I’m literally shaking as I’m typing this.

I’ll update ASAP. Thank you all again.

This was originally in the comments because I kept getting errors when editing the post, but here it is:

Update 2: I know everyone wants a detailed update. Typing this still feels so embarrassing to flesh out so I’ll try my best. Nothing bad happened though.. Not at all.

I came really close to chickening out. I got back from work yesterday and tried to act normal. She could immediately tell that something was off with me and I told her I was just tired (which was actually true, I got back later than I usually do).

But it was like everything was amplified by a hundred. I kept noticing small things that were making me crazy. Even just the way she was standing when I walked in, how she smiled at me. What she was wearing and how it fit her. Everyday things that were making me lose my fucking mind. I knew I wasn’t going to be able to sleep without telling her.

Basically I just ended up blurting it out. Romantic, I know. She was sitting with me and I told her I loved her. She said she loved me too, but we’ve said that to each other before. So I clarified that no, I meant I am *in love* with her. She went quiet for a moment and I thought I was gonna fucking pass out. Everything is a blur after that because she kissed me and I couldn’t hold back anymore. The release of everything I’ve felt for these past few years is fucking indescribable.

So…

I feel like I’m being very abrupt but all of this feels much more private to discuss now. But I can’t fucking believe it took me this long. When I woke up this morning I thought for a split second that I just dreamt everything. But with her next to me.. I’ve never felt so relieved in my life. I love her more than anything. Which I already knew, but it feels so different now. I called out of work today because I can’t pry myself away from her. I’m being extremely cheesy but I literally do not care. Good. Lol.

I might come back some time in the future and add some updates depending… Jury’s still out because she still doesn’t know about this post. I’m definitely going to tell her about it though.

And yes, the “dressing up my boyfriend” thing was part of her trying to drop hints. I asked her about it. I’m a fucking dope.

I cannot thank everyone here enough for all the encouragement and support. You’re all amazing and I wish you everything you’ve ever hoped for. I believe in you and you can do it man. Just go for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/v2p39d/pretty_sure_im_in_love_with_my_roommate_and_i/

To set the scene, I had just recently gotten my first car. It was a 96 Jetta and man was that thing rad. Also recently, I had started smoking weed. This new found pleasure of mine was awesome, but being so new to it, I didn’t know all of the things that being a now seasoned stoner seem like common sense. Things like outside perception  

So there I am, I’m over my friends house and we’re smoking a blunt in my car. Naturally, we have the munchies and start discussing our meal plan. That’s when My dad calls me:

*Yo*

**Yo**

*I’m hungry, want to go get some cheesesteaks at dicostanzas?*(my favorite cheesesteak place)

We have to pause here for a second. In my stoned little world, Jesus himself parted the clouds and gave me a little wink, as if to say “I got you bro! Enjoy yourself!” The idea of eating my favorite food while high was borderline sexual. I’d never tried real food stoned before, so this was about to be insane. 

**Does a bear shit in the woods? I’ll be home in 10 minutes**

I drive (I know, I know) home and park in my driveway. My dad is on the porch waiting, and he comes down and tells me to drive, wants to see how I’m liking the new car. 

Okay, not that big of a deal, I can just drive super cautious and everything will be okay. The only way I can imagine what *actually* happened is like a very mild version of in Wolf of Wall Street where he thought he drove the Ferrari fine and then it showed the real version. I must’ve been going 25 the whole way, stopping at stop signs and verbally spelling STOP. Probably a little swervy too, shit idk. 

We get to dicostanzas. He looks like he’s in a bad mood now and for the life of me, I just can’t understand how someone could be unhappy at a time like this. It’s CHEESESTEAK TIME BAYBEE! I walk inside, he follows me in, and I look back to ask what he’s about to get  (I know, I’m an idiot) 

**what are youuuuu about to get?**

STONE COLD STRAIGHT FACE, with that parental “if we weren’t in public I’d fuck you up” look in his eye: *give me your keys*

Confused **what?**

*you’re high as shit. Give me your keys. *😡

When I tell you I’ve never laughed so hard in all of my life. I completely lost it, like the first time I saw that scene in step brothers with the bunk beds. In the middle of this small sandwich shop, people in line just trying to order their food, and I’m SOBBING laughing. It feels like an hour I’m laughing, but I finally pull myself together and I’m just sitting there with that zen post-hard-laugh feeling, smiling ear to ear. I look at my dad again and see we aren’t on the same page..

**wait, what?**

*give me your FUCKING KEYS.*

I hand him my keys, ready to get beat up in the store, and to my surprise we just order our food and sit there and eat. Silent. 

We get back to the car and when we get in, he looks into my door card and sees half of a blunt. Picks it up and holds it in front of me. 

*You’re a fucking idiot. This isn’t your car anymore*. 

I sit in silence the rest of the ride, we get home, I go do my thing and then go to bed. 

Next morning I come back from school and my car isn’t there. My dad literally sold it while I was in school. 

TLDR: I went to get food with my dad while high, he noticed, got mad, and sold my car.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v2syt1/tifu_by_going_to_lunch_with_my_dad_while_high/

They are not, they would not hesitate to defend themselves if you move to their personal space.

Sincerely, a local Sri Lankan girl who almost got killed saving three American tourists from getting gored.

If you see a wild elephant blocking the road, pull over to the side, at least 30 m away from the elephant, turn off your engine and then wait. DO NOT drive your [rickety old Bajaj three-wheeler](https://www.dpmco.com/en/products/three-wheelers.html) all the way to the elephant's ass, get down and then try to take photos with it. My car was damaged and it would cost over 100 k rupees to fix, if parts can be found in this economic crisis. I almost died today and am lucky to escape with a broken ankle and I am pissed.

**Basically, if the animal is wild, give it space, don't go too close, don't make too much noise and don't attempt to feed it.**

Edit: The morons I met today, were doing something similar to this video, except that they parked closer to the elephant and were making a lot of noise (The morons in this video got lucky):

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xsPyoaYx5A0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xsPyoaYx5A0)

Edit 2: Footage of local moronic tourists driving right behind the elephant's ass, without keeping distance (don't do this). The people in this video got lucky:

[https://youtube.com/shorts/eqzJGICJhH4?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/eqzJGICJhH4?feature=share)

Edit 3: The power of an elephant (in this video, even though the driver was a bit of an idiot as he drove too close to the elephant in a narrow road, it was mostly their bad luck):

[Nandimitra attacks Safari jeep inside Yala - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX1Kzk4x2c8&t=105s)

(Nandimitra is the name of the elephant, many wild elephants in Sri Lanka are named)

The Americans for the most part kept to themselves and didn’t create a lot of noise. Meanwhile loud Europeans yelled to each other in groups, smoked in crowded spaces, screamed into their phones, and generally were oblivious about anyone else around them. Asian tourists were quieter and politer, but the girls especially won’t hesitate to take a picture of themselves right in the middle of a narrow walkway (✌️. If you know, you know).

I was training a new girl on Sunday and it was just me and her (I’m also a woman). About 15 minutes to last call the new girl was taking the trash out and she called me from the back door which leads to a parking lot and a dumpster. 

I go outside and there is a woman hanging out of the drivers side of a car while it’s speeding away, the driver is punching and pushing to get her away. She falls and rolls a few times, and I head her way to ask if she’s ok. She responds by standing up and charging me and my coworker at full speed saying she was going to “fuck” us, whatever that means. 

The new girl tells her to go away and she jumps on her and starts ripping clumps of hair off her head. We get her off and she falls and rips both legs open. She takes off her shorts and exposes herself to us. We call the police.

At this point my boyfriend shows up (he works next door to me) and helps my coworker fend her off and I go in the bar to close all the open tabs and get everyone out of there. The five remaining regulars whine dramatically because they have to leave ten minutes earlier than usual. 

After everyone goes we leave this woman screaming outside and lock ourselves into the bar. She comes to the front and starts shrieking and banging on the door. We call the police again because it’s been an hour and the dispatcher is a huge bitch. “Calm down ma’am” she says.

The meth head tells us she’s going to come back and shoot us to death. 

She picks up a chair and tries to break the front door with it. 

We’re inside scared and no police.

Finally 90 minutes later the police show up. The officer apologizes. There are only 6 officers on somehow that night...? My coworker presses charges for assault as she is bleeding from the scalp and bruised up.

Today is my first day back at work and I’m here alone. I thought I was going to be ok, but honestly I’m feeling pretty jumpy and nauseous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/v2soqy/a_meth_addict_ripped_my_new_coworkers_hair_out_on/

When I was 13 my parents pulled me out of school to be “unschooled”. Basically, a form of homeschooling whereby the child chooses interests to pursue (for example, I liked science but hated math). Problem is my parents never really stuck with it, so I was basically a 7th grade drop out. Most of my days were spent at the local skatepark.    
   
I was still pretty tech savvy and highly motivated. Without a high school diploma, I worked jobs mostly though connections. I worked doing tech work for a local guys vending machine route. I also did computer repair for a local PC repair company. I owned my own business (unsuccessful, eventually closed). At 23 I realized that I was tired of being limited by the lack of a high school diploma.    
   
So, I got a GED book and started studying. I watched YouTube videos and Khan academy. I was always strong in reading and writing but my math and science were lacking. I worked through the book over the course of about 2-3 months. I took my GED and passed “with honors” (which has no real world bearing but it tells me I did well).    
   
I applied and was accepted to a local community college. I met with a guidance counselor and started on some basic courses that would be required for any degree. I used “ratemyprofessor” to find the best/easiest instructors and stayed up until midnight on registration day to ensure I got into their classes. I maintained a 4.0 GPA for most of my classes. Eventually I took biology and realized I had a real interest in it, so I took anatomy & physiology and fell in love with it.    
   
I decided to apply for nursing school (RN) and got in. I completed the program and passed the state boards in 2018, and I’ve been doing it ever since.  
   
Throughout covid the salaries of RNs were increased. Originally I was hired in at $25/hr but now am making around $35/hr. I live in a lower paying state.    
   
Looking back, getting educated was the best thing I could’ve done. I truly don’t know where I would be right now if I hadn’t taken those first steps to get my GED. My initial self-doubt when I started studying for the GED was so high, but every new concept that I learned alleviated some of the fear.    
   
For context, when I started out I didn’t even know how to multiply or divide numbers without a calculator. Anything beyond basic fractions was Greek to me. Most units of measurement, geometry, volumes, were all completely foreign to me.

Whoever made that video or decision to post deserves to be fired. The thought process behind that is out of this world in their thinking, if not blatantly spotlighting government corruption. 


The whole entire market is a meme stock, to label small-mid cap stocks as meme stocks is manipulation in itself through fomentation. If the SEC did any research, they would know that most of the “meme stocks” were pump and dump via Silicon Valley algorithms and hedge funds to regain liquidity from their short position losses and risky bets. It was also a distraction from the two stocks that “had a systematic risk” to our financial system. To the Fucking Moon. 

You wanna talk about fundamentals and do research? This market does not trade on research and fundamentals. I’m am aware of very profitable companies, that are held ETFs combined with multiple “meme stocks.” It’s all a Fugazi. I’m not mentioning these companies because this is not a DD or trade. It’s not the point of this message.

How many times has the SEC failed to report accurate and timely reports? “Do research” is what that video said. How about you continue to provide accurate dark pool information so that retail can investors can actually make decisions based upon real trades AND “fundamentals”? Fundamentals according to who? The analyst who get paid by hedge funds to place a price target in the direction they want to stock to go because there’s too many calls in the money above that number?

If you’re understaffed let me know I’d be happy to help, but understand that I live by doing the right thing so I might not be up to your qualifications.

The SEC should make a formal apology on live television because the stock market as we know it will eventually cease to exist due to the fact that the investors you are antagonizing are the ones that are going to be taking care of your generation when you need help changing your diapers. We decide how this goes in the end.

I hope you have some inside information because you’re 401(k)s and pension plans are going to be in the garbage while my “meme stocks” are only a mile away from Uranus. 

Sincerely, 
Dumb money investor

I was thinking about work 24/7. I think my OCD was killing me, I wanted everything to work perfectly and if it wasn't, I couldn't let it go. 

My CEO sent me on vacation and paid a full vacation for me,10 days in Spain. And he literally ordered me to leave my company phone in the office.

Next order is to stop answering calls unless the whole office is down. After I'm back I have project management training and communication training. And professional help if I need it when I'm back.

Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sent an email late Tuesday to “Everybody” at his electric-car company, “Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,” Musk wrote in an email titled “To be super clear.”...Musk went on to write, “Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo office. **If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned**."" .....“The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” .... “That is why I lived in the factory so much -- so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.”

In recent weeks, Musk has praised Tesla China employees in Shanghai for “burning the 3 am oil” while saying that Americans are “trying to avoid going to work at all.”

\*\*  Here is a [link](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1531867103854317568?) to Elon Musks tweet where he defended his email by saying;  ""they should pretend to work somewhere else"" \*\*

&#x200B;

Here is the full email as transcribed by [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/elon-musk-reportedly-tells-tesla-workers-to-be-in-office-full-time-or-resign.html) ;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*From: Elon Musk*

*To: “Everybody”*

*Tue. 5/31/2022 \[time stamp redacted\]*

*Subj: To be super clear*

&#x200B;

*Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of forty hours in the office per week. Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo-office.*

*If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned.*

*The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much- so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.*

*There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while.*

*Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in.*

*Thanks,*

*Elon*

I thanked him for accepting me as the person I am now, not for who I used to be. His sweet response was a quoted Line from Avengers End Game- Frigga says to Thor: “Everyone fails at who they’re “supposed” to be. The measure of a person, a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are”. 

After some pure gratitude fueled crying, I felt the relief of what seemed like an elephant being removed off my chest and shoulders! About five minutes after this conversation, he emerged from the other room saying “wanna go get shakes?!” 

Needless to say, this butterfinger shake tasted like the peace you feel when surrounded by happy dogs, and I am in desperate need of some eye drops for these mummy-dry eyeballs.

mood spoiler: >!Disappointing!<

I (40sF) have a daughter (18F) who I’ll call B. When she was younger, her father (broke up before she was born) was very involved in her life and she was admittedly a “dad’s girl” but this all changed when she turned 8 and he got married. He barely called and just abandoned her for his new family. This was obviously hard on her and she rebelled a lot. But she went to therapy and seemed good. She has been in therapy for the past 10 years. She still goes. B has not seen him since she was 12 and he speaks to her maybe 3 times a year maximum. When he calls, she believes he is now back in her life for good then he ghosts her for the remainder of the year. This being said ,B and I have a great relationship, we do everything together. She even refers to me as her best friend so I’d say we have a good relationship.

Recently was her graduation and I was excited. But then she came to me a week before and told me she is going to invite her dad and his son. And cos her dad doesn’t want to see me, I can’t come.B told me that was the only way he was gonna go. I angrily told her, I felt betrayed and wont forgive her for this. She just told me I have been there for many of her milestones and she wants her father to experience some too. Things got heated and we argued.

The night before her graduation, I pleaded with her but she ignored me when I spoke. And only said “I’m sorry but I’m not changing my mind. I left and cried until my sister offered to take me out during the graduation to take my mind of it and I agreed.

I woke up the next morning to my daughter bawling her eyes out. I looked at the time and realised the ceremony starts in 5 minutes. I asked B why she hasn’t left yet. B then tells me her father ditched her and isn’t answering anymore. I hug her and tell her to make the most of her graduation. She looked shocked and asks if I’m not going to the ceremony now her father isn’t anymore . 

She continued, about how it’ll be embarrassing to be the only one there without parents. I told I’m sorry that I already had plans. She then screamed and called me a bad mom. I apologise once again and got ready to meet my sister. I chose not to go because I felt betrayed and wanted to teach her actions have consequences, even if it broke me that i didn’t go. 

Since B returned she hasn’t spoken a word to me. And she looks depressed and like she’s been crying for ages. I’m starting to regret not going.

My sister says I did the right thing, but one of the moms at my daughter school said she was depressed at graduation and now I feel bad that I ruined what was suppose to be a day to remember because I wanted to teach my daughter a lesson. So aita?

  
She had the tickets and I can only enter with tickets. And she was obviously not going to give them to me. I would not have mind going with her father actually, I even proposed that but she said no. Honestly we broke up on good terms. I haven’t spoken to him in years though. And when I have seen their messages, it’s always small talk and nothing about me. So I don’t where this came from.

I respected her decision and didn't go. She didn't console me, even when I have done it for her countless times when her dad ditched her. She takes me for granted as she know I’ll always be there for her. She knew how much I was excited for her graduation, I was speaking about it a year before her senior year yet she uninvited me so callously.

I’ve taught her that ""Her real family will be there to support her, even when they’re disappointed in her choices,"" millions of times over the past 10 years. I’ve dropped everything to console her. And it wasn’t just that she uninvited me, she did it in a way that was so callous. How long am I going to have to wait till she learns that lesson?

  
I have supported her, her whole life. Every time she ignores my advice when I tell her to not fall for his tricks. I beg her to leave him alone. And Every time she chooses the possibility of him over her own mother who is there 24/7 for her.  And for her not invite me to her graduation, even when I too cried.  The way I see it, actions have consequences.

I wasn’t going to set a precedent that she can treat me like shit and abandon me because she feels like it . Parents are humans too and as much we selflessly do things for our children. let’s not kid ourselves and say it is not nice to be appreciated. For the past 10 years, I have not been appreciated and instead have been tossed aside 24/7 for a father who abandons her.  
**Parents need love too. All these comments are acting like we’re robots that cannot feel emotions ever. This is the first time I ever said no to her. For 18 years I have done everything I could to make sure she doesn’t feel abandoned like her father and she just ditches me. I know parenting is self less but I want to feel appreciated. And I’m always second choice to a man that’s doesn’t appreciate her. Thank you for understanding.**

**UPDATE**

[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hopeful_Picture586/comments/v2vhs2/update_aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_daughter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) posted 6 hours later

I don’t think I’m a bad mom for this one thing. And I accept the judgements and read everything. To answer your question: B does go therapy. This isn’t the first time B has ditched me for her dad, she been doing it for 10 years. This is the first time I have said no to her after he father abandoned her. I have asked her therapist, if B is being manipulated. and she said no based on B and her father’s messages, and my daughter is just grasping onto a reality that isn’t there

Update: I went to my daughter and apologised for not going to her graduation. I also explained that it is not a nice feeling to be left out and I feel under appreciated. Also, that is fine to want her father there for her, but I should too. B told me that she’s sorry things ended this way and that she loves me(hugged me)and wants things to go back to normal. And that she acted like a bitch. I told her nevertheless I should have been there and if I could do this all over again, I would’ve gone. ( honestly I said this as I thought she now knew her dad can’t be trusted- and I felt for her).

Then I asked her if she regret uninviting me in the first place and unsurprisingly she said no. This hurt me but I figured it was because I didn’t go so it was understandable. But no, she continued saying that it was probably best I didn’t go because she would’ve been more miserable as she would have preferred her dad to be there anyway. Then I got pissed( I didn’t show it). I told her my feeling were hurt, especially since I’ve been there for her. 

She said that she’s always going to want her dad there for her big moments. I asked, even at the expense of me and knowing he most likely won’t show. And she replied “ I mean if I have to make sacrifices, I’m going to, to have my dad there. I repeated the question as she seemed to be swerving it but she just shrugged and went on her phone. 

I told her not to expect everyone to apologise and turn a blind eye when she doesn’t value them in the real world. And i also said, knowing how she feels, don’t expect another apology from me and this is the last time I’m doing this. She looked tear eyes but I left.

She was not angry when we had this conversation. And I know my daughter enough to know when she’s being insincere. And she told hugged and kiss before saying this but it’s fine, I know I’ll have to accept this is how it’s going to be.

I don’t know how other parents do this. I know her father is going to keep abandoning her and honestly I’m at my limit. And If I didn’t know whether I was wrong or not before, I definitely know I was right in not going. I know I’m going to get a lot of backlash saying this but I’m bitter and angry. 

I understand wanting her dad there but I should be on the same level of importance as him. I’m still going to be there for her when he inevitable ditches her again but if this behaviour carries on to her next graduation or wedding day. I can’t say I’ll be that apologetic to her. I should’ve just listened to NTA.

(I’m 21 M though it doesn’t really matter for this story)

I pull up to the gas station to start my day and I notice a homeless man. I’ve always had a soft spot for homeless people because I understand how much mental health can affect someone. 

Before I go into the gas station I ask the man if he needs anything, maybe some water? The man says water would be great. I go in grab a water and see there’s a buy 2 deal, so I grab two waters. I grab my stuff and proceed to check out. 

I walk out of the gas station and now the original man is sitting with another man who is wearing some dirty camouflage cargo shorts, a ripped tie-dye shirt and a neon yellow beanie. In my head I think “wow good thing there was a twofer deal on these waters otherwise I’d only have 1 water for 2 men” 

I hand the original man a water and then offered the second guy a water. He kind of just looks at me funny and stutters “I…I’m…thank you” and then grabs the water slowly. I go to my truck glad I could help some people out. 

As I’m sitting there getting my music figured out I see camouflage shorts guy get up and hand over his water to the original guy. He walks over to his own brand new looking truck and drives away.

I just assumed this man was homeless because he had an *interesting* sense of fashion.

TLDR: I gave two homeless men water then figured out one of the men actually had a nicer truck than I did. He wasn’t homeless just dressed weird.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v2m6xi/tifu_by_buying_two_homeless_men_water/

The Ancient and Old Ones watching the phasic construct of the system and planet watched as the 'failsafe plans' went into effect, replacing destroying fighting positions and gating in the strongest slavespawn they had. Tens of thousands of reinforcements from eight servitor species rushed through the space-time bridges, already armed and armored, equipped fully.

Artillery and missile units picked back up their rate of fire as the nearly depleted stocks were replaced with full ammunition lockers. Air superiority craft and creatures swarmed into the air to pit themselves against the Confederate air support units. MANPADS and SAMs were fired by troops on both sides and the atmosphere became a nightmare of aerospace fighters, strikers, Dwellerspawn, missiles, and kinetic weaponry.

The servitors' fire picked back up as ammunition and casualties were replaced.

In over three dozen spots the Inheritors' advance was stopped or reversed. Units were cut off, forced to retreat, or surrounded.

The Young Ones felt the flush of victory and ensured that everyone knew that their plan to push the Inheritors past their limitations had come to fruition.

The Young Ones could taste that the Inheritors were on the edge of defeat. They could see the various units of the Inheritors, see that they were cut off, surrounded, or being forced to retreat in many areas on the planet.

The Ancient Ones conferred and conceded that it *appeared* that the Inheritors were on the edge of defeat. Their forces were in disarray, many units were surrounded, fresh troops had been gated and t-shifted in to push the Inheritors off the planet.

While the fight for orbit and possession of the system was still in doubt, the Inheritors still holding open the range far enough that the Atrekna vessels could not engage but the Inheritors' weapons could still strike, the Ancient Ones knew that the it was only a matter of time before geometry would force the Inheritor ships into close action.

Each unit was targeted, from planetside to orbit to the outer system.

The Ancient Ones and the Young Ones would continue to work the strategy to defeat them all in detail.

The Old Ones scoffed and turned back to the phasic representation of the planet and the system.

They wanted to be looking at the ebb and flow of battle when, inevitably, the Inheritors found an advantage or one of the Atrekna leadership caste made a critical mistake.

They knew they'd only have minutes, an hour at the most, to react of the battle for the system would be lost.

Concentration on the individual units would reap great dividends, the Atrekna were sure of it.

\-----

Three Star General of the Iron Twargark, Commander XXXIV Corps of  stared at the holotank.

The Atrekna t-shifts obviously, in hindsight, were able to operate despite the temporal denial munitions being expended. How, the General wasn't sure. That was a job for MilInt to figure out.

Her job was to figure out how to keep it from turning to disaster.

The entire thing felt piecemeal to General Jung.Wark. It had all been deployed within roughly the same timespan, only a bare twenty minutes between shifting in the bunker systems and reinforcements to shifting in the Kaiju Class Dwellerspawn. It *looked* like a coherent whole, but it still *felt* piecemeal to the General.

She adjusted his view, pulling back, and ran a quick time-lapse of the last thirty minutes of fighting.

There was heavy chronotron and exotic particle release detected toward the three mountain ranges that snaked across the huge protocontinent that coincided with additional Atrekna units being deployed out of those areas and into the battle. There was a massive chronotron burst, enough to 'flatten' the timestream, just like the Confederacy had used to keep the Atrekna from performing temporal replication, followed by the arrival of reinforcements, repaired and replaced emplacements, and the arrival of the Kaiju Class Dwellerspawn.

The General frowned, shaking her head and rubbing her forearms in a nervous habit.

Units were flashing across the entire system to denote ""I AM ENGAGING THE ENEMY"", even ones that were pulling back to a better defensive position.

She looked at the plans and actions of her Division and Regimental Commanders, not bothering to approve them. The battlefield was too fluid, active combat was underway in too many areas, for the commanders to have to wait for her signature to authorize them to do anything.

The ability of the commanders to make their own decisions without some General or full cluster Colonel hundreds of miles away interrupting the process had won and lost wars. Won, more than lost, in the General's opinion.

*At least Major Vuxten isn't jumping everywhere*, she thought to herself as she watched another unit cut off and surrounded suddenly shifted to advancing straight into the enemy. As she watched they broke through the Atrekna lines, linking up with an artillery brigade, then signaling that they were digging in hard.

She had faith in her commanders, had faith in their skill and training, and faith in their confidence in their subordinates.

She pulled her attention away from examining individual units and looked back at the battlefield, replaying the entire thing again.

*there*

She saw it.

When a Treana'ad Horde detachment, in tandem with the Warsteel Herd, broke through the lines of what was proving to be an incredibly tough objective, the Telkan and Hesstlan troops, backed by Tukna'rn and Hamaroosa ground forces, slammed as deep as they could, heading for the mountains.

Right after the Treana'ad and the Lanaktallan troops moved to assault an artillery division of the Atrekna, and there was a gap between the advance and the followup, that's when the entire planetary situation changed.

General Twargark smiled.

The Atrekna may not have realized it, but they had shown their weakness, what they needed to protect so much as to throw the entire planetary theater into disarray.

She turned to her adjutant.

""Signal all units in this sector,"" she ordered, tapping where the Confederate forces had managed to push deep into the enemy lines, forcing a breach that the Atrekna had just slammed the door on behind the troops. ""Advance into enemy strength at discretion.""

Her aide nodded.

""Alert these units to get ready, they'll be doing Air Assault insertions to take advantage of any damage to the Atrekna defenses,"" she said. She tapped the globe in the holotank. ""The Atrekna think of ground battles and air battles as separate things. They are still stuck back in Ninth Generation Warfare.""

She turned and rotated the holotank image.

""Get the warplans interlocked,"" she ordered. She tapped an odd spot in the mountains, where they was a large 'dent' in the mountain range. ""Start lobbing tactical atomics at that spot. Let's see how badly they want to defend it.""

Her adjutant nodded.

Three Star General of the Iron Twargark, Commander XXXIV Corps, hummed to herself as she bounced up and down on the balls of her feet.

Time to see what shook loose.

\-----

Heat alarms were wailing and the cockpit suddenly grew hotter as the massive 90 ton warmek tried to dump heat and found nowhere for it to go. Ret.lek was panting as he blocked a pair of short range missiles with his forearm, the EFP's cratering the already battered armor. He swung the girder with one hand, the other one held back, waiting for the heat to drop far enough it was safe to use the 2 Pack SRM or the autocannon, using to grab at the Dwellerspawn.

The girder smashed aside a pair of Dwellerspawn, knocking them away from the melee.

Ret.lek had dozens of smaller Dwellerspawn crawling all over him. For every one he grabbed, squished, and threw away, another half dozen crawled up his legs.

He was cut off, at least two miles from any help, and his stealth mission had gone Tango Uniform on him when he'd stumbled across a major hatching pit. The bodies of a half dozen Ohm Class Dwellerspawn were slowly deflating as the water and ichor poured from the savage wounds driven through their armor. Dozens more of the smaller ones were scattered around. The skyrakers on either side of him were stripped of their outer facades and most of the interiors of the first ten floors were empty, leaving nothing behind but skeletal structure.

The spawning pool was still on fire, the FOOF devouring it mercilessly.

Ret.lek refused to give up. It didn't matter that he was outnumbered. It didn't matter that his mech was overheating to the point that the ichor steamed and bubbled where it landed on his torso armor, that the Dwellerspawn that tried to crawl on his torso burned when they came into contact with the pitted, cracked, and damaged warsteel. It didn't matter that his creation engine was overheated and slushed out, that the nanoforges were all offline. It didn't matter that his ammunition bays were all empty and the energy weapon mounts had overheated so badly the focusing arrays were worthless. It didn't matter that he had multiple coolant leaks and several armor breaches.

All that mattered is that he was all by himself but he wasn't alone.

**FIFTEEN MEN ON A LAST RIDE** roared out of the speakers, the Mantid engineer crew blaring music to at least offset the screeching of the Dwellerspawn.

**NOTHING MORE THAN SKIN, STEEL, AND PRIDE** thundered out.

Ret.lek grabbed a flying Dwellerspawn just behind the heat and cracked it like a whip, armor and body parts shooting off of the back end as the whiplash worked against the body. He flipped the carcass over his back, reaching back and grabbing it with the other hand, letting go of the girder.

Dancing to the side to avoid acid sprays he pulled the carcass tight against his back and pulled it back and forth as he moved it up and down, then dropped it, reaching out and grabbing another girder from the bent and ruined superstructure of the nearest skyraker.

The spawning pool rippled, suddenly refilled with fluid and creatures, as some asshole Atrekna t-shifted it.

The FOOF roared up with white and blue flames as it jumped from where it had been burning the air to an all new refreshed fuel source.

An Ohm Class, easily three times his size, heaved itself out of the pool, the FOOF catching the creature's armor on fire even as it burned away the fluid on the surface of the armor. It oriented as Ret.lek backed up, knowing even as he backpedaled that he couldn't move back too far due to the fact that a collapsed skyraker blocked his way.

**VALKYRIE VALKYRIE CAN YOU SEE ME?**

Ret.lek grabbed the beam with both hands, pulled it back over his head, and flung it at the Ohm Class.

**ANCESTORS ANCESTORS CAN YOU HEAR ME?**

The girder fluttered through the air, hit the Dwellerspawn, and bounced off, a split second contact enough for the FOOF to jump to the girder and start devouring it to.

The Dwellerspawn moved forward slowly, lifting its head up to stare into the eyes of Ret.lek's 90 ton warmek.

**BLADE AND SPEAR THE BATTLES NOT WON**

Ret.lek took two steps forward and swung his fist from down near his knee, jumping up into the air.

**DON'T COUNT ME OUT TILL I'M DEAD AND DONE**

His fist impacted the bottom of the point of the Dwellerspawn's jaw, the graviton spike driving deep into the spawn's chin, shattering bone and teeth as the head snapped back.

**VALKYRIE VALKYRIE ARE THOSE YOUR ARMS I FEEL**

Ret.lek backed up as the head slowly came down, his promixity alarms going off as he backed up against the shattered skyraker.

""VALKYRIE DON'T COLLECT ME WITHOUT MY STEEL!"" Thundered from above.

Ret.lek looked up just in time to see a battered and worn 100 ton Giest warmek drop from where it had stepped off the hundredth floor of the skyraker, plummeting through the air.

The impact of the 100 ton warmek hitting the Dwellerspawn's spine sounded like the continental plate had snapped. Viscera and ichor spewed up in a fountain as the entire mid-section of the Ohm Class Dwellerspawn exploded into rags of flesh.

The shockwave knocked Ret.lek onto his butt, the back of his mech hitting the rubble.

The warmek ripped out of the corpse with two movements, stepping in front of Ret.lek long enough to hose him off with plasma enhanced thermite-napalm, then turning and hammering the spawning pool with a six-pack of rockets.

""Take five, son,"" Ret.lek heard over the channel. ""Dump heat.""

The iron-gray haired icon of the XO appeared in his vision.

Ret.lek found himself nodding silently, his mouth open in shock as he watched the XO go to work.

He'd heard about the Mad Lemurs of Terra in a fight, but had never seen them.

The stories had, if anything, understated it.

In less time than it took Ret.lek's mech to drop from OVERLOAD to yellow heat, the spawning pool and everything around it had been reduced to rubble and molten rock and metal.

The XO turned around, the battered warmek holding out a hand.

Ret.lek took it, letting the bigger warmek pull him to his feet.

""Cool down, we'll link up with the rest of the company. Scout missions are off, squidbillies are making a push across the entire sector,"" the XO said. The warmek turned back and forth at the waist, the XO's head moving left and right.

""Good job, son,"" the XO said. ""Held them long enough for me to get here, that's what counts.""

Ret.lek just nodded.

His heat dropped into dull yellow.

""Let's go,"" the XO said.

The two Davion class heavy warmeks moved between two shattered skyrakers, slowly climbing the hill of debris.

Above them missiles and rockets dueled with counter-battery fire in the cloudy sky.

I’m just posting this to hopefully motivate/inspire at least one person, this thread has helped me so much so I thought I’d try and give back. 

These pictures are myself going from 360lbs to 260lbs in a 16 week period from 7th February 2022 - 30th May 2022. Sorry the pictures are a bit out consistency.

Keto has really helped me and accelerated my fat loss, I feel better than ever, have more energy, better mental clarity and generally feel better all round. 

I’m not done yet, I have around 55lbs - 60lbs to go, I am 6ft 3 & 27 years old, male. 

I’m a bit of a Reddit shadow where I read loads but but don’t post often, if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask and I will do my best to respond. 

For anyone out there struggling, you’ve got this & can easily get back on track! 💪🏻

I'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback. It sets back the block to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously.

I believe Johnny's attorneys succeeded in getting the jury to overlook the key issue of Freedom of Speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the UK.

I’m on mobile and English is not my first language so please excuse any error.


Last Friday, I attended my friends’ wedding where we had a mini high school reunion. During dinner, the newlyweds, Bhel and Pat, approached our table. Bhel and I (28F) haven’t seen each other for so long and have only been updated on each other’s lives through Facebook posts, so I had to ask her about how she and Pat got together since he has been living in another country and from what I know, they’ve only been together for two years. Apparently, they’ve been having a mutual but secret crush on each other since high school and it was partly because of me.

Bhel reminded me that I made a match out of her and Pat in high school, and it was then that I recalled how mischievous I was then. Bhel was a new student in our freshman year and she was very shy and quiet, so one day, I decided that she and Pat, who was also very shy, were the perfect match. I started teasing them and soon enough, the whole class paired them up too. I can no longer remember the details but I recall that during our third or fourth year, Bhel admitted to our friend group that she already liked Pat, but none of us knew then that it was actually a mutual feeling. I think the teasing still continued until we graduated in 2010.

But nothing came out of this at first. Life went on for both of them when Pat and his family migrated to another country after high school. I guess they’d chat with each other once in a while until the pandemic hit and they started getting serious. Pat already proposed twice over video calls last year and both times Bhel said yes, but due to strict protocols, it was only last month when he finally got to come home. He proposed again to make it official even though they were already preparing for their wedding.

I found their story to be very wholesome and heartwarming so I just wanted to share it here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/v2mhrv/my_high_school_friends_got_married_last_week_and/

My newest book is The History of the Computer!

It's an illustrated overview of the computing machines that have changed our world—from the abacus to the smartphone—and the people who made them!

[Watch me read a robot my newest book](https://rachelignotofskydesign.com/the-history-of-the-computer)
 
Since 2016 I have been publishing books, puzzles, and postcards with Penguin Random House. You may know me from my first book: Women in Science. 

Or maybe you know me from my other books: What’s Inside A Flower?, The Wondrous Workings of Planet Earth, Women in Art and Women In Sports. 

My work is inspired by history and science. I believe that illustration is a powerful tool that can make learning exciting.  I use my graphic design background to make dense information fun and accessible.

For those of you planning to go to protests that might be opposed by forces that use tear gas:

Go get a bottle of apple cider vinegar, ziploc baggies and some fabric (I use bandanas). Put a bandana in the bag with enough vinegar to soak it but not enough to pool in the bottom. If you are tear gassed, deploy the bandana over your nose and mouth and HAUL ASS. It will give you about 4-5 minutes of protection from the gas, so it will only burn your eyes, not your lungs.

**The Joker went to the fundraiser to test a hypothesis: Is Harvey Dent The Batman?** Yes the Joker left suddenly, but it was only after he got his answer.

Look at the night from the perspective of the Clown Prince of Crime. Harvey Dent is having a fundraiser, but Harvey isn't anywhere to be seen. Then you threaten Rachel Dawes, Harvey's girlfriend, and suddenly Batman appears. Batman then risks his life to save Harvey's girlfriend. 

**The Joker confirmed his hypothesis that Harvey was Batman, and had no reason to stick around.** In the interrogation scene, Joker says to Batman, ""for a while I really thought you were Dent, the way you threw yourself after her [Rachel]."" He didn't mention Harvey confessing he was Batman, he mentioned the fundraiser, which happened before.

Leaving the party would also be really easy; you have guns and no one is going to try to force you to stay.

(JUN2022FREE1 code is used up)

https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=JUN2022FREE2

Udemy has changed their promo code and severely limited the number of sign ups I can provide each month, so only sign up if you are reasonably certain you can eventually finish the course. [The first 15 of the course's 50 videos are free on YouTube if you want to preview them.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)

Instead of having unlimited free sign ups for 6 days per month, Udemy only lets me make 2,000 free sign ups per month. >:(

**NOTE: Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy's subscription plan. The subscription plan is free for the first seven days and then they charge you. It's selected by default. If you are on a laptop and can't click the BUY checkbox, try shrinking the browser window. Some have reported it works in mobile view.**

Sometimes it takes an hour or so for the code to become active just after I create it, so if it doesn't work, go ahead and try again a while later.

Some people in India and South Africa get a **""The coupon has exceeded it's maximum possible redemptions""** error message. [Udemy advises that you contact their support if you have difficulty applying coupon codes, so click here to go to the contact form.](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?type=student)

Side note: My latest book, [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/), is out. It's a collection of short but complete games, animations, simulations, and other programming projects. They're more than code snippets, but also simple enough for beginners/intermediates to read the source code of to figure out how they work. The book is released under a Creative Commons license, so it's free to read online. (I'll be uploading it this week when I get the time.) The projects come from this [git repo](https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames).

**Frequently Asked Questions:** (*read this before posting questions*)

* This course is for beginners and assumes no previous programming experience, but the second half is useful for experienced programmers who want to learn about various third-party Python modules.
* If you don't have time to take the course now, that's fine. Signing up gives you lifetime access so you can work on it at your own pace.
* This Udemy course covers roughly the same content as the 1st edition book (the book has a little bit more, but all the basics are covered in the online course), which you can read for free online at https://inventwithpython.com
* The 2nd edition of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is free online: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/
* I do plan on updating the Udemy course for the second edition, but it'll take a while because I have other book projects I'm working on. If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.
* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later. I'll be writing a blog post to guide first edition readers to the parts of the second edition they should read.
* I wrote a blog post to cover [what's new in the second edition](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2019/10/07/whats-new-in-the-2nd-edition-of-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/)
* **You're not too old to learn to code. You don't need to be ""good at math"" to be good at coding.**
* Signing up is the first step. Actually finishing the course is the next. :) [There are several ways to get/stay motivated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get.2Fstay_motivated_to_learn_programming.3F) I suggest getting a ""gym buddy"" to learn with.

One of those events was for a presidential and vice-presidential candidate.  You get a kind of VIP pass which gets you up front but not on stage.

So, I am newer to politics and was newly familiar, and in attendance with this woman who was a long-time volunteer/activist with the party.  She remarked that she wished she was on the stage instead of in the crowd.

I turned to her and said, if you want to get up there, I'll get you up there.

Would you believe she looked at me and scoffed that she was way more important than me and she didn't need my help getting up there.

So, long story short, I walked onto the stage and sat with the others.  I literally just walked right past security and secret service like I belonged on that stage.  Didn't even glance at them like I was unsure.

The entire time I kept waving at the lady who was still in the crowd.  She looked SO mad the entire event.

I have to admit it was boring as hell sitting up there because you can't move around or anything since all eyes are on you.  I really wish I hadn't gone up there except for the fact that I loved that this woman was so damned annoyed with me being up there.... it made it all worth it.

I feel like it's a pretty common thread to see pop up on this subreddit to talk about what subclasses folks want or cannot believe don't exist yet - Plant Druids, Dragon Warlocks, Fiend Sorcerers, all the good stuff. Well, I've mined some of those threads for some ideas, added in a few suggestions folks on my discord added, to let my patrons vote in a series of polls on which of these ideas needed to happen.

These are a little different then some of my usual content as they are intended to be the sort of thing you could plausibly find in the PHB or XGE, rather than anything too crunchy. These are intended to be pretty simple and straightforward subclasses that render obvious ideas into the playable reality. I don't want this to override the discussion about what you want to see (from WotC or from blokes like me), but I did want to iterate on the conversation a little by providing a solid starting point to fill part of that void (for where homebrew is a viable option anyway).

### The List

* [Barbarian: Path of Instinct](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MnF2ORszRxnnb6uU6Q3) - An instinctual warrior who's rage is a state of perfect focus.

* [Druid: Circle of Elements](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Mtz16KIDMwFyerhks5F) - A druid that manifests elemental powers to manipulate the battlefield.

* [Druid: Circle of Growth](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MnEzVunzRaDRGfWao30) - A plant druid who conjures a seedling that's empowered as they use their magic.

* [Fighter: Adventurer](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MsNRg8I_MBhYtXuVYvL) - An resourceful fighter that always seems to have a spare potion or scroll. The most basic form of adventurer.

* [Fighter: Brawler](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MnF2LCpRzJeqGSTTTzy) - A rough and tumble fighter for whom anything (or anyone) nearby is a weapon.

* [Ranger: Bounty Hunter](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MrxoFZz1Bn3HI0IQ-in) - An urban ranger who tracks down their prey... dead, alive, or some mix between the two.

* [Rogue: Divine Hand](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LW4nZ5ZiGLUPConaV6e) - A holy inquisitor who's original subclass name was stolen by a non-holy inquisitive rogue.

* [Sorcerer: The Fiend](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MlmInyP8sPBGqphpU_2) - A sorcerer that inherited a darker legacy... blame Warlocks (...or Bards).

* [Sorcerer: Sea Soul](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MCVeaKouXb3q7N0Qgss) - A waveborn sorcerer that pushes about their foes with the turbulent power of the ocean. Originally inspired by a UA concept, but long sense set adrift.

* [Warlock: The Dragon](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MjAx7CqmUwg0b1wu5Jw) - The lowest hanging fruit. The pages that were clearly just missing from Fizban's. The most obvious answer to the question ""why does that not exist?""

The PDF and FoundryVTT module also include revised versions of [Champion Fighter](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MdpX65aceDo8QRS49Mw) and [Assassin Rogue](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MDTE2pn1JQGTxJAN_qN), but those are just included for folks that want more from those ideas. They felt they had a place here as they are such iconic parts of an adventuring line up, but don't quite rise to modern standards (...or the standards of the time the PHB was published, for that matter).

Of course, I've also got all of these loaded into a FoundryVTT module for you, if you're into that sort of thing:

### [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aafaooDlIHQb1JUdCITQACpj2PpUzENi/view?usp=sharing)

This is a little messy, but I wanted to include a format for folks that have issues with GMBinder. It's basically just all the GMBinder versions stitched together, but should be perfectly functional, just with some extra white space.

### Notes, Design, and Balance

These have all gone through playtesting, and basic scrutiny thereof, but I'm not going to claim the are flawless masterpieces ready to be framed. They are sort of like things I make in my spare time. If you have feedback, feel free to leave it here, or on [my Discord](https://discord.gg/msWF9EP). They generally aim to be moderately conservative in balance, but remain useful and relevant. These are stuff I know players using, and stuff I allow in my own games, so I'm not setting out to make things overpowered. They do usually contain a few neat tricks to make them unique though. I don't think any of them are the strongest iterations of their class, and I'm moderately confident none of them will break the game, but if you find something off or disagree, feel free to let me know.

### What's Next?

So, what's left? What are the remaining subclasses you cannot believe don't exist yet? There's a new poll, live now, for Generic Subclasses Part 3, and any ideas that aren't captured in the polls yet from this thread will be added to the next poll at the start of next month. 

**Want your idea seen and voted on for the next poll? Post it below!**

**Want to be the one that wields ultimate executive power >!...by voting in a poll with hundreds of other people!< ?** [Join the patreon and have your say in the current poll!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/generic-part-3-67174578) ;)

I don't promise to make *everything* posted, but I will include as many options as possible in my next poll, and post them (for free, as always) when they are done and through at least one round of testing. I will probably make about 2-4 of them over the next month (these things take time to trickle through testers, they are just blokes playing D&D after all). And then we just keep going until the internet collective decides ""yes, we have everything we want"" (or the more likely cases, that I eventually go insane and/or run out of ideas to turn them into new subclasses).

The the links to all of these can be found [on my website](https://www.kthomebrew.com/), as well as what I term ""extended"" subclasses that offer further afield concepts (such as what if you wanted to *turn into* the tree... well, that's something that I somehow offer *two* options for, depending on if you [want it Druid form](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LW4mknFMoxjrSjitvn6) or [whole new class!](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-Mii4Yor9g8z1xko2gN6))",https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/v2gl3q/that_monthly_what_subclasses_can_you_not_believe/

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Cantabria is one of the seventeen autonomous communities that Spain is comprised of. It's located in the northern coast of the Iberian peninsula, and it borders the autonomous community of Asturias by the west.

&#x200B;

The [Picos de Europa National Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Picos+de+Europa/@43.1885135,-4.8000234,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0xd49c893856535cf:0x7291815fe2dcd950!8m2!3d43.1872155!4d-4.821524!5m1!1e4) is a mountain range that extends between Asturias and Cantabria. [Its green forests, snowy peaks and pristine lakes](https://rafairusta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/galeria-picos-de-europa.jpg) attract an average of three million tourists a year, from all over the world. These tourists are however warned against venturing into the national park without proper guidance; the ""Picos"" are every bit as treacherous as they're beautiful. Deaths by misadventure at the park are not a strange occurrence; hikers that wander out of the safe paths and end up falling to their deaths and off-piste skiers swallowed by avalanches top the list of fatalities. Rain and snow storms can often happen with little warning, temperatures as low as -35 ºC (or -31 ºF) have been recorded during these blizzards. Many still unsolved missing people cases have taken place there, and in at least two separate instances SAR helicopters have crashed into the mountains while looking for them, killing their crews. And finally, there's the (less likely) risk of dangerous encounters with the local wildlife; most of Spain's confirmed bear attacks on humans have taken place at that area. Wolves and wild boars can pose a risk to humans at the park as well.

&#x200B;

In summary, a visit or walk around this breathtaking national park is not without a series of fatal dangers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Eloy Campillo**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In 1945, [Eloy Campillo Pérez](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/dSLFH-t55CJb_YYp__mamWfKnl4=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/NMQR2TFZZZCE5FHGHRNE4Y6EFA.jpg) was 31-years old. He was a park ranger at Picos de Europa. He was also the major of a small town named [Sotres](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33554+Sotres,+Asturias,+Espa%C3%B1a/@43.2326742,-4.7477525,547m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd49c807f699c411:0xcb93ca5863efedc3!8m2!3d43.2326044!4d-4.7468755), located just afoot of the northern Asturian side of the park. 

&#x200B;

Eloy's circumstances had placed him in a really, really tough spot. Previously a monarchy, Spain [became a democratic republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Spanish_Republic) in 1931 after rebel forces deposed the wildly unpopular King Alfonso XIII (who had supported the conservative dictatorship of Army general [Primo de Rivera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera) between 1923 and 1930). A new Constitution and parliament were installed instead, with socialists and progressive parties winning the first elections by a landslide. After five years in which social tensions between the left and the right wing rose to concerning levels, Spain held the General Elections of 1936, pitting the Popular Front (socialist, Marxist, progressive) against the National Front (conservative, monarchist, religious). While the parties were more evenly matched now, once again the left won as the Popular Front officially scored some 110,000 more votes than the National Front. Many prominent names among the conservatives started to plot a coup d'etat, and one of these was [José Calvo Sotelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Calvo_Sotelo), a conservative politician that had previously served in the dictatorial government of the aforementioned Primo de Rivera. His assassination in July 13th, 1936 sparked a three-year long, very bitter, brutal and bloody [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War), at the end of which Army general [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) (who had the support of the European Axis powers) imposed a fascist-conservative dictatorship that lasted until his death in 1975. This state of affairs, added to the nation-wide famine that spanned through the 1940's (a consequence of the war) spurred [rebel guerrilla forces](https://static3.leonoticias.com/www/multimedia/201809/26/media/cortadas/maquisyminers-k2oH-U601040235013LVD-984x608@Leonoticias.jpg) that aimed at getting rid of the anti-democratic Francoist Regime that had just been imposed. These guerrilla fighters often hid in the wilderness, as the Civil Guard (supportive of Franco) was in the lookout for anyone who actively opposed the Regime.

&#x200B;

*Note; this explanation of the political circumstances of Spain at the time is extremely simplistic, and the reality was way more nuanced that I've just described here. Anyone who wishes to get a better grasp of it should take a look at the Wiki articles I've linked in this writeup.*   

&#x200B;

As the major of his hometown, Eloy's job was to ensure the town would function according to the existing laws. Which means he was required to inform Law Enforcement of any anti-Francoist activity he'd notice going on. On the other hand, his job as forest ranger often ensured he'd be in touch with many of these guerrilla rebels, and Eloy was cordial and sympathetic to many of them -many of which had been his childhood friends before the war. Reportedly, Eloy just wanted to be left out of politics, and he paid lip service to the Regime to avoid getting himself and his loved ones in trouble.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Eloy's disappearance**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eloy's burdens worsened in April of 1945, as the fall of Berlin at the hands of the Soviet Red Army became imminent. His friends among the exiled guerrilla forces became bolder than ever, thinking that they'd soon be able to restore the Republic with the help of the Soviet Union (along with Mexico, the only helping hand they got against Franco during the war). In spite of this, Eloy had agreed to a secretive picnic [at a rural house in the park](https://ibb.co/16mrswQ), with his guerrilla friends as well as some uninvolved friends and acquaintances. One of these guerrilla fighters was 27-years old [Juan ""Juanín"" Fernández Ayala](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9FUOtA9PA84/WpyOY-Ka1EI/AAAAAAAApXU/C6Co5KAJtWQ2rPu2hwW4MmvqyB8rUEgFQCLcBGAs/s1600/juanin%2B%25281%2529.jpg), who had fought in the republican side during the war. The picnic took place on Sunday April 15th. Two days earlier, on  Friday 13th, Eloy had mentioned the picnic to one of his fellow park rangers, Alfonso Martínez. Alfonso notified the [Civil Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)) about the picnic, and the officers organized a raid. 

&#x200B;

Around noon of that Sunday several Civil Guard officers approached the rural house where the picnic was being set. Reportedly, Eloy was seen by the officers at the scene, unarmed. The guerrilla fighters initiated fire, and a shootout ensued. One guerrilla fighter and two Civil Guard officers were killed before the Civil Guard team, feeling outgunned, retreated back to the town for backups. By the time such backups reached to the scene the guerrilla had fleed to the mountains. Eloy was nowhere to be seen.

&#x200B;

Juanín and the guerrilla suspected (rightfully) that someone that knew of the picnic had snitched on them, which was confirmed when they found a letter in the pocket of one of the fallen officers. Such letter mentioned Alfonso's snitch, but also Eloy was referenced there. Because of this, on April 24th (nine days after the shootout) the guerrilla abducted several men at gunpoint and took them to a cave in the park for questioning. Eloy was among these taken hostage.

&#x200B;

After hours of questioning (and torture) all but two hostages were let go, already late into the night. One of these two remaining was Eloy. He, along with another man, were forced at gunpoint to march in the darkness deep into the park. Reportedly, they were finally executed by gunshots, and many guerrilla fighters that would later surrender in the following months would point at Juanín Fernández as the man that executed Eloy.

&#x200B;

Months later the relatives of both men would learn about their demise. The other man's body was quickly retrieved for burial. However, Eloy's body could not be located in spite of extensive searches by the Civil Guard and volunteers. And its whereabout would remain unknown for 73 years.

&#x200B;

Juanín Fernández was never captured by the authorities, and remained an active guerrilla fighter for the rest of his life. [He was killed on April 24th, 1957](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Tumba_de_Juan%C3%ADn.jpg/1200px-Tumba_de_Juan%C3%ADn.jpg), precisely twelve years after Eloy's disappearance, during another shootout with the Civil Guard. Theoretically, only he knew where he presumably had executed Eloy and where his remains were. 

&#x200B;

 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The discovery of Eloy's remains**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In the summer of 2018 a team of professional spelunkers made it into [a pit cave named Torca de Topinoria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33554+Sotres,+Asturias,+Espa%C3%B1a/@43.2201762,-4.6859813,34m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0xd49c807f699c411:0xcb93ca5863efedc3!8m2!3d43.2326044!4d-4.7468755), on a hill in the eastern end of the Picos de Europa National Park. The entry is basically [a long but very narrow, easy to miss crack on the ground rock](https://img.europapress.es/fotoweb/fotonoticia_20190922164648_1200.jpg). In fact, it's considered a danger to hikers on winter because snow makes it even harder to spot until it's already too late.

&#x200B;

This narrow crack is very deceiving. Soon into the descent, the cave leads to [a very wide main shaft](https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/HE4AFLMFZBD2XLILWABWTGUI4I.jpg), which descends [almost fully vertically for 180 meters (590 feet)](https://ibb.co/44ffr8L) down to a muddy bottom full of debris. This team of spelunkers had been exploring many pit caves in northern Spain, looking to find the whereabouts of people that had gone missing during the civil war and the Francoist Regime. Like Eloy's case, which in fact was one they already had included in the search plan.

&#x200B;

[After a careful inspection of the mud and debris at the bottom](https://ibb.co/R20nqYt), some human bones were found. Among these were part of a skull that had still retained pieces of its jawbone. Even though no teeth remained, some DNA could be extracted for analysis later on...

&#x200B;

After 73 years, Eloy Campillo Pérez had finally been found.

&#x200B;

The news were soon shared with Eloy's daughter Mercedes, who was only two years old when Eloy disappeared. Mercedes, aged 75 in 2018, [hiked all the way to the pit cave's entrance](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/0CLZ0L-drt830gmKXyovuh2EQmE=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/JIJUM6T2LBA6FF22RHC7TSVJRY.jpg) later on during subsequent expeditions. She had been actively looking for her father's whereabouts since the 1960's. 

&#x200B;

Further searches on the cave later on retrieved more of Eloy's bones. His skull bones showed [evidence of a gunshot injury](https://ibb.co/hLCHkSQ), and [the shell of a 9mm-Largo](https://ibb.co/CWxV3tt) bullet fired by an [Astra 400 handgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_400) was found nearby as well. Juanín Fernández himself owned a copy of such model, which is currently on display at the [Army Museum](https://ejercito.defensa.gob.es/museo/en/index.html?__locale=en) in Toledo. However, the museum's authorities didn't authorize a comparative analysis on the gun, fearing it could damage it.

&#x200B;

Eloy's skeleton was reconstructed as further as possible during the summer, with [the spelunkers making several descents](https://ibb.co/x7zwVNJ) and searches to look for the rest of his scattered remains. The case of Eloy Campillo was now a closed case, even if it couldn't be proved if it was indeed Juanín Fernández who killed him. However, this closure made room to a new, baffling mystery;

&#x200B;

[There were other bones that clearly couldn't belong to Eloy](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/X6yqX-SPg_N-YsApxBGBSgA2H1Q=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/QWX5ZSFY65DPNK2ACGPYTTU2QA.jpg) because of their morphology and, more importantly, because many of these would have no place on Eloy's skeleton. Who was this other person? Was another victim executed along with Eloy that night of April 24th, 1945? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The unidentified girl**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The spelunkers worked now on the retrieval of two different people. Little by little, more of this person's bones popped out during the search.

&#x200B;

[Another jaw bone was found, which had still retained some teeth](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/AiFsc7i8vsg-sTPYtWHJj_dBHk0=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/7PGOZFMFTVHF7EFXQR4N4FBOCM.jpg) where DNA could be sampled from. Soon it was determined that the bones belonged to a female individual. Further analysis of her key bones (like her femur) yielded more exhaustive data; she was very young, with her age at the time of her death estimated to be 10 to 14-years old.

&#x200B;

How did this girl end up here? Did she spend her last minutes of life next to Eloy's still warm corpse? Turned out, she couldn't possibly have; analyses done by [ICA Inc. in Sunrise, Florida (United States)](https://www.radiocdating.com/) \-where one of her teeth had been sent to- in December of 2019 showed that this girl died at some point between 1950 and 1960. Which means that by the time she ended up at the bottom of the pit cave Eloy had been dead for five year at the least.

&#x200B;

The first conjecture about her identity created a very logical and plausible scenario; this girl could possibly have been a young shepherd, or just the child of a family of local shepherds (at the time a plentiful demographic in the area). Given the treacherous morphology of the cave's entrance, she may have accidentally fallen while walking or running around. Maybe it could even happened one winter when the snow had concealed the crack even further, as mentioned earlier.

&#x200B;

However, the analyses performed by accomplished forensic anthropology doctor [Fernando Serrulla](https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/3V7wOPx3O_0jM7k7hA0zrhph6ME=/1960x1103/arc-anglerfish-eu-central-1-prod-prisa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KH6QJEE6HDGMHNOBAHI34FBTOY.jpg) (who had managed to give the names back to 88 unidentified fallen soldiers of the Falklands War and has been asked to help in the case) soon casted a doubt about this potential scenario. For starters, the content of stable isotopes in the bones found did not support the idea that she could have been a rural shepherd. [The high amount of δ13C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) in her remains pointed at a diet very rich in either corn or seafood protein. But given the fact that [relatively high levels of δ15N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9415N) were found as well (indicating a diet rich in animal protein), the corn diet angle became less likely. According to Dr. Serrulla, this girl likely grew up on a coastal region, and her diet was heavily based on fish.

&#x200B;

Speaking of her diet, it was less than adequate. One of the first bones found was her right femur, and from the get go Serrulla and his team observed signs of femoral and cranial [porotic hyperostosis (""spongy bones"")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porotic_hyperostosis), a condition that is a consequence of chronic malnutrition during childhood. This piece of information wouldn't be of much use to single out any Spanish demographic in particular; given the intervals for the time of her dead and her age, it means that she was born at some point between 1936 and 1950. As mentioned earlier, [Spain had gone through a period of famine in the aftermath of the Civil War](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022009419876004), being at its harshest during the early 1940's but lasting until well into the 1950's. Pretty much only the ruling class and the wealthy could secure means to maintain proper nutrition. The majority of Spanish people, on the other hand, lived in a constant state of food insecurity. Therefore, the girl found at the Topinoria pit cave could belong to virtually any working class family.

&#x200B;

Her DNA was further analyzed in order to create a description of what she could have looked like. As said earlier, she was a prepubescent girl whose age at the time of death sat somewhere between 10 to 14 years. Her most probable height was 141 to 142 cm (or about 4ft8), although she could have been also as short as 136 cm or as tall as 147 cm (4ft6 and 4ft10, respectively). She was of European ancestry, although there isn't more precise data about this point. She was probably fair-skinned, and her eye color was likely either green or honey-like. Her most probable hair color was a dark shade of brown.

&#x200B;

Locals were questioned about a girl with these characteristics that may have gone missing; the elderly was asked, and so were people whose ancestors had lived there and could possibly have mentioned it to their children and grandchildren. This endeavor was ultimately in vain; there seemed to be no local recollection of a girl of these characteristics going missing.

&#x200B;

The closest the investigators got to a possible lead was a little historical fact about the area; back in the Francoist times there were records of small settlements of outsiders, away from the towns. These outsiders came from many other parts of Spain, looking for better opportunities in the northern part of the country (where the mining industry has traditionally provided a living thousands of families). These people built their own sheds and sacks on the hills afoot of the national park. It was learned during the investigation that one of these settlements had been located not far from the Topinoria pit cave. Therefore, it's believed that this girl may have belonged to a family of settlers, and the authorities never learned about her life nor death. This is currently considered to be the most plausible explanation on her origins.

&#x200B;

Her DNA profile was uploaded to the [Fénix Database](https://elpais.com/diario/1999/05/22/sociedad/927324014_850215.html), a project launched in 1999 by the Civil Guard to help and solve cold cases, as well to identify long unclaimed bodies. However, *Fénix* had nothing to show to the investigators about the Topinoria girl. No one related to her is in there.

&#x200B;

Taking this angle a step further, her DNA was sent internationally to be pitted in other DNA databases, one of these samples being sent to the United States to be compared in the [FBI's CODIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet). And yet again, zero results yielded; her relatives aren't there either.

&#x200B;

[Since only 18% of the girl's skeleton has been retrieved](https://ibb.co/wWmFHvM) (in contrast with 90% of Eloy's) it has not been possible to determine the exact cause of death. The analyses on this aspect have yielded strange results; even though she likely fell down the cave's 180m (590 ft) main shaft, most of her remains found did not show sings of high-energy impact -for example, the bones of Eloy's right leg, his jawbone, pelvis and many ribs were shattered, most likely by the impact against the cave's bottom. In fact, [her femurs were intact](https://ibb.co/5hTNpfX), and so was her jaw. The only bone fractures found so far are restricted to her cranial bones. The head injury was determined to have happened perimortem (at ot around time of death). 

&#x200B;

There are two main scenarios being considered about her death; accidental (she accidentally fell down the pit cave and died on impact with the bottom) or criminal (she was murdered by blunt force trauma to the head and her killer ditched her body down the pit cave). Given the small amount of bones retrieved so far, investigators are not favoring one scenario over another.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Aftermath**

&#x200B;

As for June of 2022, the identity of the Topinoria girl remains a mystery. While the investigation is still ongoing, there are no significant DNA leads to date.

&#x200B;

[Eloy Campillo's remains were eventually given to his family](https://ibb.co/4KJMg35), so he could have a burial. He is buried at the cemetery of Sotres, the same town he was the major of.

&#x200B;

Mercedes Campillo has allowed the Topinoria girl to be buried at that same cemetery as well, right next to her father's grave. *""After they've been so many years together down in the cave, it wouldn't be fair to part them now""*, she told the investigators.

Hey - I saw Tilian post his response and I can't be quiet about this. As hard as it is, I'm here to share my story after reading Throwawaywithhumanhair's experience and wanted to corroborate. Guys when I say I'm fucking so upset to share this news, knowing how devastating and unfathomable it is to hear, I am beyond upset. Like most of you, DGD has been such an important band to me since I was a teen (you can see in my post history.) I preordered their vinyls, I went to their concerts alone. Which is why I was so excited to see that Tilian liked me on Hinge. Hearing this news today is absolutely wild because this literally happened last week and I've been debating posting on here knowing how serious allegations like these are. I have screenshots of all our texts, Hinge convo, and a picture of his apartment (which I took because I thought his plaques were cool especially as a fan) which I'll attach at the end. 

We go on a gorgeous date on a rooftop bar, the sun was setting, he really set a scene. Throughout the date I was thinking to myself, wow we're actually connecting, even though he didn't ask me a ton about myself, I chalked it up to him being shy/grieving (he said he had just gotten back from Tim's funeral). I was able to connect with him on that since my best friend also OD'd. We actually cheers'd to them. It all felt really nice. Good date. We hang out around downtown LA, riding scooters, try going to a bar, it's too sceney, yadayada. Skip to the end of the night. He asks to go back to his place for a glass of wine just to drink on the rooftop. At this point I was like okay yeah I see where this night could be going  - but I have a rule. I don't have sex on a first date. But you know doing other stuff outside of sex is cool (for clarity: going down on each other.) Wasn't cool to Tilian. 

I told him that when we got to his apartment and his sweet and shy personality flipped. Started making fun of me for this ""rule"" I had. Kept negging me. Making fun of me, then being really nice, then making fun of me. We still did other stuff,  that's cool. But I tell him again no sex. There was a moment during other stuff where he was staring at the ceiling, looking really angry, and I asked if he wasn't into it and wanted me to go and he said ""what are you insecure?"" I say ""what? no."" Then he tries putting it in raw - no condom. I'm like ""No. That's my vagina. I don't want to have sex like I said."" I keep pushing his penis away. He keeps trying. I keep trying to push it away. He then says a quote that is burned into my brain ""what's the difference? I've already been in your mouth."" 

Then there was this very scary moment where he was on top of me ""are you really going to stand your ground on this?"" I tried pushing him off and he didn't move. I tried again he didn't move. He stared at me. I tried again. We did this for a bit. Having to push back multiple times against a guy who's silently staring over you and not budging is terrifying. Especially after I said no a ton of times. I then realized I had to make a horrible decision in that moment. Either I fight back way more physically against this guy who is bigger and stronger than me in his own apartment and have a high likelihood of getting raped, or I act like it's my own decision to gain some autonomy over the situation and just take it. So we had sex. Was it enjoyable? Absolutely not. I numbed out. I was so scared what would've happened if I fought back more. Not to mention the whole weird power complex of him being the singer of a band I love. At the end of the night he said he had to get up early for a doctors appointment and I left because I felt horrible anyways. The next day I text him saying how awful the sex felt (text linked below.) Got no response. Him not responding made me feel crazy. I couldn't believe this person that made music that meant so much to me and got me through so much could do something like this. And now I can't listen to them ever again, which fucking sucks. He came across as so sweet and kind before and during the date and then really chameleoned into my worst fear. I now understand why he didn't reply because it would implicate him. 

Again, I'm so sorry to be the one to relay this news. I know how shitty this news is. I really don't want this to be true and I was the one that was there. Based on the comments on the other post you can feel free to believe or not with the pictures I do have, I'm just here to share. Anyways, I'm getting STD tested this week - will post with any update. 

I love this fan base so much and it really kills me to share this. You guys have been always been somewhere where I don't feel so alone whether it's by myself at a concert or on here writing about our fave songs and have been such an amazing place of support and love. Thank you for that and thanks for reading.

I have always been annoyed by the size of the loaves of pre-sliced sandwich bread sold at grocery stores. I can never eat an entire loaf before it goes moldy and I don't think forcing myself to eat way more bread is a good idea.  I have discovered that I can break up the loaf into separate containers and freeze the excess but that is annoying.  Why do grocery stores not sell half loaves or quarter loaves of bread?  My theory is that the current size is based around a married couple with 2-3 kids that is feeding their kids multiple sandwiches a day, that is the only way I could see going through that much bread that fast, but surely single people and childfree couples are not an insignificant portion of the market.  I first noticed this when  I moved out of my parents house and was only buying food for myself, when I got married it got a little better but we still cannot eat a loaf of bread before it goes moldy.  Does anyone have any insight as to why sandwich bread loaves are the size they are?

TL;DR

New neighbor cut down 8 trees after agreeing to wait until we discussed when I returned from work. He lawyers up first and sends me a letter saying I gave him permission, so I sue him for timber trespass and his insurance settled with me, then he sues me for quiet title so he can cut down the rest of the trees. Turns out these are special county “retained significant trees” so I turned him in to code enforcement and now he has to replant them or face $40,000 worth of fines. County says if they don’t re-plant trees they’ll go after the HOA and make them do it. Also got the county on him for his illegal duplex that he then had to gut.

Long story:

Bought my house in part because it had a completely private back yard screened in by \~50-60ft tall douglas firs and western red cedars running along the property line. There was a single house on the other side of the trees (after their driveway), but was otherwise basically a forest back there. About a year after I moved in I came home at lunch to find almost half of the trees along my back property line had been torn down. Apparently a developer had purchased that lot and was going to build a bunch cookie-cutter townhomes, but they left the main house that was already there. I was pretty upset at that removal, but the developer gave me a survey excerpt that showed the remaining trees were situated directly upon the property line and professed they only removed trees that were completely theirs (they lied). I was young and naive so I took them at their word, after all they would know what they were talking about right? And I didn’t want to make waves being new to the neighborhood, plus it allowed more sun to reach my backyard, so I let it go. Sadly in WA the statute of limitations for timber trespass is 3 years, so by the time I gained much of my knowledge in this area it was too late to hold the developer accountable.

Fast forward 4 years and I come home for lunch, again, and find my backyard trees being cut down, AGAIN… Only this time I had the survey from the developer that clearly showed the trunks of the remaining trees were directly on the property line. The trimmer was dropping branches into my yard and onto my shed which damaged the gutter (I didn’t notice this until later). After getting some attitude from the tree trimmer I asked him if he knew where the property line was (he didn’t), and to go ahead and get the owner so we could have a chat. A lady comes out with a cellphone and the man on the line introduces himself as Jake (name changed for the story, but it is important that he gave me a specific name). Jake says he’s the owner and tells me that he wants to remove the trees and put up a fence, and that maybe he would plant some fruit trees on my land as recompense. I tell him that the fence won’t provide the same privacy that these 60ft tall trees do and I’d like them to not be cut down. He informs me that he also bought the property just to my north and that he wanted to be a good neighbor and wanted me to be a good neighbor too (which I took as a veiled threat). I told him I had the developer’s survey showing the trees were on the property line so we should both agree what happens to them. He wanted me to wait so he could come back from wherever he was but I had to get back to work so I told him to stop cutting and we could discuss later that evening, he agreed and I left to go back to work. At some point he called me back, but I was at work so let it go to voicemail where he confirmed we’re to meet that evening to discuss what happens to the trees.

My wife gets home later that day and sends me a text that guys are cutting the back trees down… Luckily it was close to the end of day so I sped home and told the trimmers in no uncertain terms to GTFO of my trees. While I was there I met the HOA president (I didn’t know their development was part of a HOA until then), and he informed me he also told them not to cut down the trees.

So Jake comes over later that evening and brings a younger man with him he only introduces as his nephew. I explain that in Washington State trees that are directly on the property line are owned by both property owners as tenants in common and can’t be cut down without both owner’s consent. He takes a picture of the developer’s survey and I tell him I need to get an arborist to figure out what damage has been done and how best to address it, and that the rest of the trees won’t be coming down. I was still trying to be neighborly so I didn’t bring up that he ignored our agreement to stop, I did say if he had come to me before maybe we could have worked something out. He says he understands and they leave. In the interim, HOA president and I are texting and he gets super belligerent that I’m considering pursuing the neighbors for damages, he apparently thought I should just let them cut down the trees and be happy they’re building a “nice fence”. He asserts that I must be angling to sue the HOA, which I tell him makes zero sense because they’re not the ones who authorized the cutting, and he tells me not to contact him anymore. Ok then… (HOA president owns a car-wash and has a bunch of reviews about how belligerent he is, which makes sense from my experience with the guy).

A couple days later I get a letter from Jake’s attorney stating I had given them permission to cut down the trees and therefore had no cause to ask them for damages, threatening all sorts of legal hell if I sue. Considering I had his voicemail confirming we were meeting later to discuss the trees I felt pretty confident I could overcome this claim, but it was still enraging to have someone so blatantly lie like that. It also turns out that “Jake” was really named Harry and his nephew was the one named Jake, I guess Harry thought it was easier to pretend he was Jake when dealing with neighbors (they’re both on the property deed)? I don’t understand the logic but it was at that point I realized they were all liars and there was no resolving the issue amicably, so I sued them for timber trespass. Took about 2 years but their insurance eventually settled, albeit for not as much as I would have gotten if I’d gone to trial which I wish now I had. They lied and repeatedly changed their story during discovery, at one point they said their trimmer would attest I told him to continue cutting (instead of my giving “Jake” \[Harry\] permission like they originally claimed), but they were then unable to produce a statement from him (he noped the fuck out when I sued them, left his rigging gear on the trees and everything). I also found out they had multiple code violations for grading and building without permits, so they have a history of flouting the rules and don’t seem to think the rules apply to them… Anyway we signed a release for the damages and their insurance cut me a check. I figured the matter was closed and they understood the trees were co-owned and weren’t going to be cut down without my permission.

Well… late last year I get a knock at my door. It’s a process server and I’m being sued for quiet title by Jake and Harry. Their complaint is from some no-name attorney and, aside from not including the exhibits, is vague, blatantly retaliatory, and frivolous. Doesn’t mention trees, or the property line, just some language about how they think I’m going to make a claim to their property at some point in the future.

So now I’m pissed and the gloves are off. I pulled the paperwork for their development and found the landscape plans and tree inventory reports. Apparently all new developments in our county are required to retain a certain number of trees for canopy coverage, and this requirement passes on to the property owners. So these trees were specifically retained, placed in a private easement, and the plat map for the development states the trees shall be maintained and replaced if damaged. Same plat map says HOA is responsible for stepping in if the individual owners don’t replace the damaged trees too.

Looking up the county codes confirms all of this, these trees were designated “retained significant trees” and cannot be removed without county authorization. If they are removed, the county is authorized to fine the property owner $5,000 *per tree* that was removed, recall they removed 8 of them. So I filed a code violation and the county enforcement officer came out and took pictures. He sent them a warning notice saying they must replant the trees or face fines, he also sent an email to their HOA saying if Jake/Harry don’t act they’ll come after the HOA to fix the issue.

Oh, remember how Harry said he owned the property in front of me? Yeah he rents that out and while looking up his lawsuit against me I found out he was evicting tenants… He filed a declaration with pictures of the inside showing he converted the downstairs of the home to an apartment complete with its own kitchen. Sure enough, he didn’t get any permits for this and it was what the county ended up calling an “illegal duplex conversion”. Yeah I turned him in for that and he had to gut the whole inside or again face fines. Code enforcement guy also made him clean up the outside for being a “junkyard”.

I got paid nicely for the trees they cut and now they have to replant them, the remaining trees are not coming down, and they had to gut their illegal duplex. I have more info on them if they keep it up, it would be a shame if someone investigated their other tenant properties because they’re obviously slum-lords. I’m considering letting an attorney go to town on them for their frivolous suit if they don’t accept my offer to dismiss.

They fucked around and found out, don’t mess with my trees…",https://www.reddit.com/r/treelaw/comments/v2s3bc/tree_justice_neighbors_found_out/

Gostaria de partilhar a minha história sobre como obtive essa renda passiva, então vai por aqui mesmo. Fiz as contas e posso tranquilamente não trabalhar nunca mais mantendo meu padrão de vida, apartamento próprio quitado, condomínio 1,6k mais 3k de gastos fixos, o resto fica pra eu curtir.

**Sobre mim**: curso incompleto de engenharia mecânica, neste momento faço um dinheiro com apostas no bet365. O meu objetivo era ganhar mais de 5k por mês antes dos 25, hj eu ganho 8k sem trabalhar + o rendimento das apostas que giram em torno de 1\~2k por mês.

Acabei de superar esse patamar dois anos antes.

**Como comecei:**

Comecei minha graduação em engenharia mas vi que não teria muito futuro no ramo.

1. Os meus pais sempre me ajudaram financeiramente, mesmo estudando em uma federal, eles bancavam alimentação e transporte.
2. Meu primeiro trabalho foi em 2018 ganhando 1.2k.
3. Entrei em uma IC na faculdade que me dava mais 400 por mês
4. Em 2019 um amigo me apresentou o mundo de apostas e me colocou em um grupo muito bom no telegram, com o dinheiro entrando das apostas comecei a me desligar do curso.
5. Mudei muito pouco meu padrão de vida à medida que fui ganhando mais. O maior luxo que eu tenho é neste momento trabalhar em casa.

**Investimentos:**

Tenho investimentos em várias coisas, mas até o momento que eu tinha uns 5k, estava tudo numa conta poupança. Foi neste momento que eu comecei a ler vários livros e fóruns para aprender o que fazer e obter um rendimento melhor.

**O momento que cheguei a 8k por Mês de renda passiva:**

Depois de alguns anos na faculdade e apostas, e juntar e perder dinheiro, chegou o dia em que consegui atingir 8k de rendimentos. Querem saber o segredo? Os meus pais saíram da capital e foram morar no interior e me deram um apartamento novo, além de 1 imóvel comercial que eu alugo e que me garante 8k de aluguel.

**Esta é a minha história, espero que consiga inspirar alguém a atingir os seus objetivos.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/v2td6r/como_obtive_uma_renda_passiva_de_8k_por_mês_aos/

Well, that got my attention. I went to my room for a while, then came back and announced:

""Okay mommy, you can clean now. I've put away anything I care about""

To be honest, I don't remember doing it, but I'm pretty proud of tiny me. Mom thinks it's pretty hilarious that she got outsmarted by a child.

ETA: wow, this blew up. I'm loving all the stories of other kids maliciously complying lol. You (and your kids) are all excellent. I'm trying to get through them all because it's truly a delight.

In the morning I had a healthy smoothie for breakfast. For lunch, I made some baked fish tacos. I had oranges as a snack when I was hungry. 

For dinner however, my family ordered a pizza and it was really tempting. I decided to just limit myself to 2 slices. I also drank a lot of water throughout the day. 

At the end of the day. I only consumed about 100calories over my target calorie intake of 1500 calories. 

Some things that I felt that I could improve would be trying to incorporate some from of exercise everyday like maybe walking for one hour or climbing the stairs for 15mins .

I'm not sure if anyone else can tell, but I know that I can. My mind raced wishing I hadn't declared it to be an open roll. Wishing I'd just decided to roll behind a screen.*

*But, no, her character was standing in front of the wight. It had been attacked three times, if I was rolling behind the screen nobody would believe it missed four times in a row anyway. Everybody knew even one successful attack would result in her barbarian's death. This wasn't the first time that Brudla had held back overwhelming odds so that her friends could deal with the problem. And it bummed every single person at that table out that it would be her last.*

*""This die represents how long you guys have before Brudla's body transforms into a Wight."" I said, and then turned back to Brudla's player. ""You've got twenty minutes to roll up a new character"" She nodded, putting on a good attitude, ""maybe I'll roll somewhat decent this time"" (Brudla had the worst ability scores I've ever let into an actual game.)*

I have fudged rolls.

I think every DM on this forum has.

I think there is one basic reason for this. Every DM knows what their goal is. It's that the players should have fun. 

This is the standard. Not ""the players should be engaged"", not ""the players should feel triumphant"", not ""the players should feel emotional"", but that *""the players should have fun.""*

Frequently this is taken to even more of an extreme, well outside of what the original advice intended. Every decision is compared against this. ""If I decide to do X, will the players have fun?"" This is just a recipe for stripping all of the emotional lows out of your game. 

Fun is important in a game. That's why it's impossible to lose any co-operative game. Game designers realize that losing isn't fun, and so it's impossible to lose Pandemic, and you can't die in Mario. 

It's why Dark Souls is so unpopular.

Every movie, book, and game you've ever played would *suck* if at every moment the director/writer/designer asked, ""is this fun?"" and stripped out the parts for which the answer was ""no"". Even the slap-stickiest comedy has low points. 

So why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we fudge^1 ?

There's a theory about lying, I haven't been able to track down the citation (and if somebody has it that'd be great). People are **most** likely to lie when they satisfy the following criteria:

1) They are responsible/face consequences for a particular result

2) They have no control over the result

3) They have total control over what result is reported

Sound familiar?

--------------------------------------------

Sure, I've fudged, but I still let characters die in important battles, or when they've done something stupid. I just do it when they're gonna fall down the stairs and break their necks in the second-to-last fight, or if the boss monster is going to go down in the first round. So what's the big deal?

The problems with fudging are basically the same as the problems with all lying.

**1) Lies beget lies**

Have you ever watched a TV show or movie where the main characters feel like they have plot armor? They run down a battlefield with bullets whizzing past their heads and there's no tension because you know in your heart they can't get hit? 

Consequences of having a protagonist. You can't kill them halfway through the movie. So what do you do? Movies *need* tension! So you put them in more and more dangerous situations. Situations bad enough that the audience forgets what they know, and feels fear for the protagonist. 

So what happens when you the DM does this? The players start to feel like they can't die in non-boss encounters as long as they aren't ""stupid""^2 . This means that these encounters are boring, or ""too easy"". So the DM has to spice them up. Some guy is out there working his way through the whole damn monster manual to make combat more exciting. D&D combat is very exciting, and has a ton of tension when you really believe your character might die. Once it becomes ""who can come up with the coolest description on the road to our inevitable victory"" you've lost most everybody.

Intuitively DM's understand this so they start fudging their combats to make them closer. Once you've started fudging on the bad guys side, then you'd feel *really* terrible if a PC died because you cheated. So that means the entire combat has to be fake. Every die roll that jeopardizes the script of ""as close as possible, but without negative emotions"" has to get thrown out.

In comparison every other combat becomes bland and feels one-sided, so you have to keep doing it.

What are you going to do? Admit you fudged?

**2) Lies undermine trust**

The first fudge is free.

It'll avoid a horrible moment in one of your games. Nobody is ever going to figure out that you lied for that one particular roll, out of thousands. Everybody in this game has rolled a natural 1 before, nobody is going to question it if a random skeleton doesn't crit the wizard. 

The problem is that lying is like driving and sex. Everyone thinks they're better than average. 

After a year of play people will start to notice that all of the rolls that really, really matter have gone in a predictable direction. (Why fudge a roll that doesn't matter after all?) So they start to trust you less. 

How important is it that the players trust the DM?

------------------------------------------------------------

So what can we do about it?

That theory of lying isn't just ""bad people lie"". It is damned hard *not* to fudge. The best solution for it I've ever seen is the ""Box of Doom"" from Brennan Lee Mulligan's Dimension 20. 

Whenever there is a critical roll the DM rolls it in the open, *after* explaining what needs to show up on the die for success or failure. (None of this decide the DC after the fact crap). 

This accomplishes three things.

1) You can't lie about the result because the players can see it.

2) You feel less responsible because you no longer have to be the bearer of bad news. 

3) You *become* less responsible for it, because you no longer have assigned to yourself the position of judging whether a particular PC death, boss death, or similar was ""worthy"" of being in your game. The story of the game becomes about what *happens in the game* rather than what the DM wishes it was. 

The dice usually tell a better story on their own.

------------------------------------------------------------

For those of you that wonder how the beginning story turned out. I cried for the first time over the actions of a character when I was relating Brudla's last stand. I've been running games for almost twenty years now. If you want to know how to make your games more emotionally engaging, just stop cheating. 

D&D, at its core, is a good game. You aren't personally responsible for every moment of happiness, sadness, humor, and excitement at the table. You can, by trying to eliminate every negative moment, be responsible for stripping a lot of it out though.

The player actually managed to roll up a new character in 20 minutes. The whole session went really well. We managed character creation, 7 combat encounters, 3-5 obstacles, two role-playing encounters, levelling (I'd never done levelling mid session before), and two or three traps. All in a 3.5 hour session. 

It may have been the best session I've run in my 18 years of running games. There were a lot of reasons for that, but one of them was that I had finally learned to give the dice the last word.


------------------------------------------------------------
**Tl;Dr: The dice are better storytellers than you are, stop lying about what they say.** 
------------------------------------------------------------

^1 Related to, ""why do we call it fudging?"" The euphemism is there to protect the DM.

^2 Stupid being defined as whatever the DM feels like that day because it isn't determined by the dice, the DM has decided with the power of fudging they'll be the judge, jury and executioner, so stuff that the dice say should kill you might be granted mercy one day and not the next.

Me: Sir, please turn your router off. Do not turn it back on.  
Cust: Why not?  
Me: It is not standard for our router to do that, and may set your house on fire. *I then place the cust on hold while I get approval to send out a replacement router from a somewhat bemused and amused manager.* I am sending you out a new router. This one is several versions newer than your current one.  
Cust: Thank you.  


I then educated our customer on proper placement for the router, suitable surfaces to place the router, and that we should use the power supply that is included with the router.

I looked forward to school just so i can eat lunch. We didn't have the nicest clothes we didn't have much of anything. We were saltine crackers with peanut butter poor. The uniforms for middle school started to not fit me very well. I felt awkward i wanted the same style as the other girls but i knew my parents weren't going to buy me new clothes..we got shoes maybe once a year. I felt jealous i felt like i looked ugly i looked at the other girls and thought they looked so cool. I had my eye on this one girls pants it was a pair of black skinny jeans they looked great on her. Well we had gym class together and after everyone changed into their uniforms, i was the last one in the locker room. I went over to her locker and swiped her pants. I went over to another abandoned locker and stashed them, then joined the others. After gym class everyone got dressed, except the girl i stole from. The gym teachers and her friends looked around asked for whoever took them to cough it up. She ended up having to spend the rest of the day in gym shorts. I took the pants home and my dumbass wore them the next day. 
And they didn't fucking fit. I didn't take in account that she was much thinner and shorter than me.
Everyone knew whose pants those were. Everyone knew i stole her pants. 
It was so obvious i don't know how I was so dumb.
But to this day i still never confessed that i did steal them, I'm embarrassed as fuck but i did it. I admit i tried to stretch them out and wear them again here and there and keep up the lie. I was relentless i didn't steal that girls pants but they knew. 
I feel sorry that i did that, and i feel bad she had to sit the rest of the day in gym shorts, i feel stupid because they didn't even fit. I'm glad I'm more mature and i now cringe at the memory.",https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/v2xhza/i_stole_another_girls_pair_of_pants_in_middle/

I was the only offer, low open house turnout and given the macro economic uncertainty, current level of housing unaffordability and rising interest rate; I thought it was a slam dunk, as evident [by the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/uyhmwf/900k_sfh_northern_california_just_made_an_offer).

So after I made the $750k offer the seller basically told me to pound sand and countered at $890k and said he was keeping the washer, dry and fridge ...not joking... the balls on this guy!  I told him to pound sand and said i'd be back in 30 days with a lower offer.

Welp another buyer made an offer, at the asking price, for $900k and waived all contingencies. F\*ck me right?

**Fellow buyers: the market will not change unless our offers reflect the change we want to see! Stop paying the list price. Stop waiving contingencies, seriously.**

Soo, my wife and I are back to square one...again..I am disappointed but our mental model for buying a house is not changed:

1. We are not going to pay over list
2. We are not going to waive contingencies
3. We are not going to get in a bidding war
4. We are not going to FOMO or be house poor
5. I will continue to buy long dated puts on zillow, redfin and opendoor

time to smash my head into my keyboard out of immense frustration!
